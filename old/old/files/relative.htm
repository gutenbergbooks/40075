    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The travellers who now sail along the picturesque coasts within the
      district of the Bouches-du-Rhone&mdash;the peaceable inhabitants of shores
      perfumed by the orange-trees of Hyères, or the curious tourists, whom
      steamboats are continually transporting from Marseilles to Nice or to
      Gênes&mdash;are perhaps ignorant of the fact that two hundred years ago,
      under the flourishing administration of Cardinal Richelieu, the seashore
      of Provence was, almost every day, plundered by Algerian pirates, or other
      robbers from Barbary, whose audacity knew no bounds. Not only did they
      capture all the merchant vessels leaving port,&mdash;although these ships
      were armed for war,&mdash;but they landed under the cannon even of the
      forts, and carried away with impunity the inhabitant whose dwellings were
      not adequately armed and fortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      These depredations increased to such a degree that in 1633 Cardinal
      Richelieu instructed M. de Séguiran, one of the most eminent men of that
      time, to visit the coast of Provence, for the purpose of ascertaining the
      best means of protecting them from the invasion of pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will quote a passage from the memoir of M. de Séguiran in order to give
      to the reader an exact idea of the scenes which are to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in the town of La Ciotat, a sentry-box which the
      consuls have had built on one of the points of the rock of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle,
      in which they keep a man, very expert in navigation, on guard night and
      day, to watch for pirate vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every evening, toward nightfall, the guard in the sentry-box of La Ciotat
      kindles his fire, which is continued by all the other similar sentry-boxes
      to the lighthouse of Bouc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a certain signal that there is not a corsair in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the said guard in the sentry-box has, on the contrary, recognised one,
      he makes two fires, as do all the others from Antibes to the lighthouse of
      Bouc, and this is accomplished in less than a half-hour of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inhabitants of La Ciotat confess that commerce has been better during
      the last few years. But as far as can be learned, it is ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The corsairs from Barbary in one year seized eighty vessels and put about
      fifty of their best sailors in chains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, so great was the terror that these Barbary pirates
      inspired dong the coast that every house was transformed into a fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Continuing our way,&rdquo; says M. de Séguiran, &ldquo;we arrived at the house of the
      lord of Boyer, gentleman of the king&rsquo;s chamber, which house we found in a
      state of defence, in case of a descent of the corsairs,&mdash;having a
      terrace in front, facing the port, and on it twelve pieces of cast iron,
      several pieces of less calibre, and two swivel-guns, and in the said house
      four hundred pounds of powder, two hundred balls, two pairs of armour, and
      twelve muskets and short pikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Bormez and at St. Tropez,&rdquo; says M. de Séguiran, further on, &ldquo;commerce
      is so seriously injured that it cannot amount to ten thousand pounds,
      which is a consequence not only of the poverty of the inhabitants, but
      also of the invasions made by pirates, who enter their ports almost every
      day, so that very often vessels are compelled to touch port, in order that
      the men who man them may escape, or the inhabitants of the place arm
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Martignes, a community which has suffered great losses in the persons
      of its inhabitants,&mdash;esteemed the best and most courageous seamen on
      the Mediterranean,&mdash;many of them have been made slaves by the
      corsairs of Algiers and Tunis, who practise their piracies more than ever,
      in the sight of the forts and fortresses of that province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reader can imagine the contempt of these Barbary pirates for the forts
      on the coast, when he knows that the seashore was in such a deplorable
      state of defence that M. de Séguiran says, in another passage of his
      report to Cardinal Richelieu:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day, January 24th, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, we went to
      the fortified castle named Cassis, belonging to the Lord Bishop of
      Marseilles, where we found that the entire garrison consisted of a porter
      only, a servant of the said bishop, who showed us the place, and where
      there were only two small pieces of ordnance, one of which had been
      emptied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, the Archbishop of Bordeaux made the same remark in reference to one
      of the strongest positions of Toulon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first and most important of these forts,&rdquo; says the warrior prelate in
      his report, &ldquo;is an old tower where there are two batteries, in which fifty
      cannon and two hundred soldiers could be placed; there are good cannon
      within, but all are dismounted, and no ammunition, except what was sent by
      order of your Eminence [Cardinal Richelieu] fifteen days ago. The
      commandant is a simple, good man, who has for garrison only his wife and
      her servant, and, according to what he says, he has not received a
      farthing in twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of things a few years before Cardinal Richelieu was
      invested by Louis XIII. with the office of grand master in chief and
      general superintendent of the navigation and commerce of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In studying attentively the aim, the progress, the methods, and results of
      the government of Richelieu,&mdash;in comparing, in a word, the point of
      departure of his administration with the imperious conclusion of absolute
      centralisation toward which it always tended, and which he attained so
      victoriously,&mdash;one is especially impressed by the character of the
      navy, by the incredible confusion and multiplicity of powers or rival
      rights which covered the seashore of the kingdom with their inextricable
      network.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cardinal was entrusted with the maritime interests of France, he
      could count but little upon the support of a weak, timid, restless, and
      capricious king; besides, he felt that France was secretly agitated by
      profound political and religious discords. Alone, opposing the exorbitant
      pretensions represented by the most powerful houses of France,&mdash;haughty
      and jealous guardians of the last traditions of feudal independence,&mdash;it
      was essential that the will of Richelieu should be indomitable, even
      obstinate, in order to crush beneath the level of administrative unity
      interests so numerous, so tenacious, and so rebellious! Such was, however,
      the work of this great minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that the ardent and sacred love of the general good, the
      noble, instinctive perception of the needs and progress of humanity,&mdash;those
      pure and serene aspirations of a DeWitt or a Franklin,&mdash;would not
      have sufficed the cardinal in undertaking and sustaining so fierce a
      struggle; perhaps, too, it was essential that he should feel himself
      animated by an unbridled, insatiable ambition, in order to cope with so
      many formidable antagonisms, to despise so many outcries, to prevent or
      punish so many dangerous revolts by prison, exile, or the scaffold, and at
      last achieve the end of gathering in his dying and sovereign hand all the
      resources of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by this means&mdash;we think so, at least&mdash;that the genius of
      Richelieu, exalted by an unconquerable personality, succeeded in
      consummating this admirable centralisation of conflicting powers,&mdash;the
      constant aim and glorious end of his administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, he died at the time he was beginning to organise this
      authority so valiantly conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      If France, at the time of the cardinal&rsquo;s death, presented still upon her
      surface the distinct evidences of a complete social overthrow, the soil
      was at least beginning to be freed from the thousand parasitical and
      devouring forces which had so long exhausted her strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, one might say that almost always eminent men, although of diverse
      genius, are born in time to achieve the great labours of governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Richelieu, that resolute and indefatigable clearer of untilled ground,
      succeeds Mazarin, who levelled the earth so profoundly ploughed,&mdash;then
      Colbert, who sowed it, and made it fruitful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imperial will of Richelieu appeared under one of its most brilliant
      aspects in the long struggle he was obliged to sustain, when he was
      entrusted with the organisation of the navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that time, the governor-generals of Provence had always challenged
      the orders of the admiralty of France, styling themselves the &ldquo;born
      admirals&rdquo; of the Levant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, they pretended to the maritime authority of the province; a few
      of these governors, such as the Counts of Tende and of Sommerives, and, at
      the period of which we speak, the Duke of Guise, had received from the
      king special letters which conferred upon them the title of admiral. These
      concessions, drawn from the weakness of the monarch, far from supporting
      the pretentions of the governor-generals, protested, on the contrary,
      against their usurpation, since these titles proved clearly that the
      command of sea and land ought to be separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we see how divided and antagonistic were these rival powers, that the
      cardinal, in performing the functions of his office as grand master of
      navigation, wished imperiously to unite and centralise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be seen by this rapid and cursory view, and by the extracts which
      we have borrowed from the report of M. de Séguiran, that a frightful
      disorder reigned in every department of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disorder was the more increased by the perpetually recurring
      conflicts of jurisdiction, either through the governors of the province,
      or through the admiralties, or through the feudal claims of many gentlemen
      whose estates commanded a forest or a river.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, abandonment or disorganisation of fortified places, ruin of
      commerce, robbery of the treasury, invasion of the seashore, terror of
      populations retiring into the interior of the country, in the hope of
      flying from the attacks of these Barbary pirates,&mdash;such was the
      grievous picture presented by Provence at the period in which this story
      opens,&mdash;a story of incredible facts which seem rather to belong to
      the barbarity of the middle ages than to the seventeenth century.

      CHAPTER II. MISTRAON
    </h2>
    <p>
      About the end of the month of June, 1633, three distinguished travellers,
      arriving at Marseilles, established themselves in the best inn of the
      city. Their dress and accent were foreign. It was soon known that they
      were Muscovites, and although their attendants were not numerous, they
      lived in magnificent style. The eldest of the three travellers had called
      upon the Marshal of Vitry, Governor of Provence, then residing in
      Marseilles, and the marshal had returned his visit, a circumstance which
      greatly enhanced the dignity of the foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      They employed their time in visiting the public build-ings, the port, and
      the docks. The preceptor of the youngest of these travellers, with the
      permission of the Marshal of Vitry, made careful inquiry of the consuls
      concerning the productions and commerce of Provence, the condition of the
      merchant service, its equipment and destination, evidently anxious, for
      the benefit of his pupil, to make a comparison between the growing navy of
      the North and the navy of one of the most important provinces of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day these Muscovites directed their journey toward Toulon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest of the three foreigners appeared to be fifty years old. His
      countenance presented a singular union of pride and severity. He was
      attired in black velvet; a long red beard covered his breast, and his
      hair, of the same colour, mingled with a few silver locks, showed beneath
      a Tartar cap trimmed with costly fur. His sea-green eyes, his sallow
      complexion, his hooked nose, his heavy eyebrows, and his thin lips gave
      him a hard and ironical expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked at some distance from his companions, and seldom spoke, and when
      he did it was only to hurl at them some bitter sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The age and appearance of the two other Muscovites presented a striking
      contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      One, who seemed to be the preceptor of the younger, was about forty-five
      years old. He was short and fat, almost to obesity, although he seemed to
      have a vigorous constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore a long robe of coarsely woven brown silk, after the manner of the
      Orientals, and an Asiatic cap; a Persian dagger of rare workmanship
      ornamented his girdle of orange-coloured silk. His fat, ruddy face,
      covered with a thick brown beard, and his thick lips breathed sensuality;
      his small, gray eyes sparkled with malice. Sometimes, in a shrill voice,
      he gave vent to some jest of audacious cynicism, frequently in Latin, and
      always borrowed from Petronius or Martial; so that the other two
      travellers, with allusion to the taste of their companion for the works of
      Petronius, had given him the name of one of the heroes of this writer, and
      called him Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pupil of this singular preceptor seemed at the most to be only twenty
      years of age. His person was of the ordinary size, but most elegant; his
      dress, like that of the Muscovites of the age, was a happy union of the
      fashions of the North and the East, arranged with perfect taste. His long
      brown hair fell in natural curls from a black cap, flat and without brim,
      set on one side and ornamented with a gold and purple band; the two ends
      of this band, finely embroidered and fringed, fell over the collar of a
      black woollen jacket, embossed with designs in purple and gold, and
      fastened to the hips by a cashmere shawl; a second jacket with loose
      sleeves, made of rich black Venetian fabric, and lined with scarlet
      taffeta, reached a little below the knees; large, loose Moorish trousers,
      hanging over red morocco buskins, completed the picturesque attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      An observer would have been embarrassed in assigning a certain character
      to the countenance of this young man. His features were of perfect
      regularity; a young, silky beard shaded his chin and lips; his large eyes
      shone like black diamonds, under his straight brown eyebrows; the dazzling
      enamel of his teeth scarcely equalled the deep carmine of his lips; his
      complexion was of a soft brown pallor, and his slender figure seemed to
      combine strength and elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this physiognomy, as charming as it was expressive and variable,
      reflected in turn the different impressions which the two companions of
      this young man made on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Trimalcyon uttered some gross and licentious jest, the young man, whom
      we will call Erebus, applauded it with a mocking, sneering smile, or,
      perhaps, replied in words which surpassed the cynicism of his preceptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the nobleman, Pog, a silent and morose man, made a remark of unusual
      bitterness, suddenly the nostrils of Erebus would dilate, his upper lip
      curl disdainfully, and his whole face express the most contemptuous
      sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, if Erebus did not come under these two fatal influences,
      or an absurd boasting did not make him appear the advocate of vice, his
      face would become sweet and serene,&mdash;an attractive dignity beamed
      from his beautiful features; for cynicism and irony only passed over his
      soul,&mdash;noble and pure instincts soon resumed their sway, as a pure
      fountain regains its clearness when the disturbing element no longer
      troubles its crystal waters. Such were these three distinguished persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking, as we have said, from Marseilles to Toulon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus, silent and thoughtful, walked a few steps in front of his
      companions. The road plunged into the defiles of Ollioules, and hid itself
      in the midst of these solitary rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus had just reached a small open space, where he could overlook a
      great part of the route, which at this point was very steep and formed a
      sort of elbow around the eminence upon which the young man stood.
      Interrupted in his reverie by the sound of singing in the distance, Erebus
      stopped to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice came nearer and nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a woman&rsquo;s voice, with a resonance of wonderful power and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air and the words she sang expressed an unaffected melancholy. Soon,
      at a sudden turn of the road, Erebus could see, without being seen, a
      company of travellers; they quietly accommodated themselves to the step of
      their saddle-horses, that climbed the steep road with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the coast of Provence was often desolated by pirates, the interior of
      the country was as little safe, for the narrow passes of Ollioules,
      solitudes almost impenetrable, had many times served as a refuge for
      brigands. Erebus was not astonished to see the little caravan advance with
      a sort of military circumspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The danger did not seem to be imminent, for the young girl continued to
      sing, but the cavalier who led the march took the precaution to adjust his
      musket on his left thigh, and at frequent intervals to test his firearms,
      leaving behind him a little cloud of bluish smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, a military figure in the full strength of manhood, wore an old
      leather jerkin, a large gray cap, scarlet breeches, heavy boots, and rode
      a small white horse; a hanger or hunting-knife was fastened to his belt,
      and a tall black hound, with long hair and a leather collar bristling with
      iron points, walked in front of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      About thirty steps behind this forward sentinel came an old man and a
      young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was mounted on an ambling nag, as black as jet, elegantly
      caparisoned with a silk net and a blue velvet cloth; the silver mounting
      of the bridle glittered in the rays of the setting sun; the reins,
      scarcely held by the young girl, fell carelessly upon the neck of the nag,
      whose gentle and regular step by no means interrupted the harmonious
      measure of the beautiful traveller&rsquo;s song.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore right royally the charming riding-habit so often reproduced by
      painters in the reign of Louis XIII. On her head was a large black hat
      with blue feathers, which fell backward on a wide collar of Flanders lace;
      her close-fitting coat of pearl-gray taffeta, with large, square basques,
      had a long skirt of the same material and colour, both skirt and waist
      ornamented with delicate lace-work of sky-blue silk, whose pale shade
      matched admirably the colour of the habit If one ever doubted the fact
      that the Greek type had been preserved in all its purity among a few of
      the families of Marseilles and lower Provence, since the colonisation of
      the Phoenicians,&mdash;the rest of the population recalling more the
      Arabian and Ligurian physiognomy,&mdash;the features of this young girl
      would have presented a striking proof of the transmission of the antique
      beauty in all its original perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more agreeable, more delicate, or purer than the
      exquisite lines of her lovely countenance; nothing more limpid than the
      blue of her large eyes, fringed with long black lashes; nothing whiter
      than the ivory of her queenly brow, around which played the light chestnut
      curls that contrasted beautifully with the perfect arch of eyebrows as
      black as jet, and soft as velvet; the proportions of her well-rounded form
      resembled Hebe, or the Venus of Praxiteles, rather than the Venus of Milo.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sang she yielded herself to the measured step of her steed, and
      every movement of her charming and graceful body revealed new treasures of
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her small, arched foot, encased in a boot of cordovan leather, laced to
      the ankle, appeared from time to time beneath the ample folds of her long
      skirt, while her hand, as small as that of a child, gloved in embroidered
      chamois-skin, carelessly played with the switch by which she urged the
      gait of her nag.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to picture the frankness which shone from the pure
      brow of this young girl, the serenity of her large blue eyes, bright with
      happiness and hope and youth, the unsophisticated sweetness of her smile,
      and, above all, the look of solicitude and filial veneration which she
      often directed toward the aged but robust father who accompanied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eager, hardy, and joyous air of this old gentleman contrasted not a
      little with his white moustache, and the vinous colour of his cheeks
      announced the fact that he was not indifferent to the seductions of the
      generous wines of Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A black cap with a red plume, a scarlet doublet trimmed with silver, and
      mantle of the same, a shoulder-strap of richly embroidered silk,
      supporting a long sword, and high boots of white sheepskin, with gilded
      spurs, testified to the quality of Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, chief of
      one of the most ancient houses of Provence, and related or allied to the
      most illustrious baronial houses of Castellane, Baux, Frans, and
      Villeneuve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road which the little caravan followed was so narrow that it permitted
      two horses to walk abreast with difficulty; a third person rode a few
      steps behind the baron and his daughter. Two servants, well-mounted and
      well-armed, closed the march.
    </p>
    <p>
      This third person, a young man of about twenty-five years, tall and
      well-made, with a handsome and amiable face, managed his horse with grace
      and ease. He wore a green hunting-habit, trimmed with gold lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face expressed an indescribable delight in the contemplation of Mlle.
      Reine des Anbiez, who, without discontinuing her song, every now and then
      turned to him with a charming glance, to which the Chevalier Honorât de
      Berrol responded with all the ardour of an infatuated and betrothed lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron listened to his daughter&rsquo;s singing with joy and paternal pride;
      his genial and venerable countenance beamed with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His contemplative felicity was, nevertheless, not a little disturbed by
      the sudden jumps of his little horse, brought from the island of Camargne,&mdash;a
      bay stallion with long mane and a long black tail, a wicked eye and
      ferocious disposition, full of fire, and evidently possessed with a desire
      to unhorse his master and regain his liberty in the solitary swamps and
      wild heath where he was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for the designs of Mistraon,&mdash;named for the impetuous
      northwest wind, on account of the rapidity of his gait and his bad
      character,&mdash;the baron was an excellent horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although suffering from the consequences of a wound in the hip, received
      in the civil war, Raimond V., seated on one of those ancient saddles which
      in our day we call picket-saddles, answered these vicious caprices of the
      untamable animal with sound blows of whip and spur. Mistraon, with that
      patient and diabolical sagacity which horses carry to the point of genius,
      after several vain attempts, stolidly waited a more favourable occasion
      for dismounting his rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine des Anbiez continued to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a child, she amused herself by waking the echoes in the gorges of
      Ollioules, making by turn loud and soft modulations, which would have put
      a nightingale to despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had just made a most brilliant and musical arpeggio, when suddenly,
      anticipating the echo, a male voice, sweet and melodious, repeated the
      young girl&rsquo;s song with incredible exactness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments these two charming voices, meeting by chance in a
      marvellous union, were repeated by the many echoes of this profound
      solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine stopped singing, and blushed as she looked up at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron, astonished, turned to Honorât de Berrol, and said, with his
      habitual exclamation: &ldquo;Manjour! chevalier, who in the devil is imitating
      the voice of an angel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the first moment of surprise the baron had unfortunately let the reins
      fall on Mistraon&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time the deceitful animal kept his step with a gravity and
      dignity worthy of a bishop&rsquo;s mule, then in two vigorous bounds, and before
      the baron had time to recover himself, he climbed up an escarpment which
      shut in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, the horse had made such an effort in ascending this steep
      acclivity, that he fell upon his head, the reins went over his ears, and
      floated at random. All this happened in less time than is required to
      write it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron, an excellent master of horse, although not a little surprised
      by the adventure of Mistraon, reseated himself in the saddle; his first
      effort was to try to seize the reins,&mdash;he could not reach them. Then,
      notwithstanding his courage, he shuddered with horror, as he saw himself
      at the mercy of an unbridled horse that in his frenzy was trying to leap
      the precipitous edge of a torrent bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This deep and wide gulf lay parallel with the road, and was separated from
      it only by a space of fifty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/040.jpg" alt="Seized the Bloody Bridle " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Seated in his saddle, and by reason of his wound unable to get out of it
      before the horse could plunge into the abyss, the old man gave his last
      thought to his God and his daughter,&mdash;made a vow of a weekly mass and
      an annual pilgrimage to the Chapel of Notre Dame de la Garde, and prepared
      to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the height where he was standing, Erebus saw the danger of the baron;
      he saw that he was separated from him by the deep bed of the torrent, ten
      or twelve feet wide, toward which the horse was plunging.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a movement more rapid than thought, and an almost desperate leap,
      Erebus cleared the abyss, and rolled under the animal&rsquo;s feet The baron
      screamed with terror,&mdash;he believed his saviour would be carried over
      into the golf, for, notwithstanding the pain and fright which this violent
      jerk had given him, Mistraon was not able to arrest the impetuosity of his
      spring, and dragged Erebus several steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, endowed with extraordinary strength and admirable presence of
      mind, had, as he fell, wound the reins around his wrists, while the horse,
      overcome by the enormous weight which hung upon him, seated himself on his
      haunches, having exhausted the impulse which instigated such activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely ten steps separated the baron from the edge of the gulf, when
      Erebus slowly raised himself, seized the bloody bridle-bit with one hand,
      and with the other threw over the smoking neck of Mistraon the reins which
      he offered to the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this transpired so rapidly that Reine des Anbiez and her betrothed,
      climbing the escarpment, arrived near the baron without having suspected
      the frightful danger he had just escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus, having replaced the reins in the old man&rsquo;s hands, picked up his
      cap, shook the dust from his clothes, and readjusted his hair, and, save
      the unnatural flush upon his cheeks, nothing in his appearance revealed
      the part he had taken in this event.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, father, why did you climb this steep? What imprudence!&rdquo; cried
      Reine, excited but not frightened, as she bounded lightly from her nag,
      without seeing the unknown person standing on the other side of the
      baron&rsquo;s horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seeing the pallor and emotion of the old man as he made a painful
      descent from his horse, the young girl perceived the danger which had
      threatened the baron, and throwing herself into his arms, she exclamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, father, what has happened to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Reine, my darling child,&rdquo;
       said the lord of Anbiez with a broken voice, embracing his daughter with
      effusion. &ldquo;Ah, how frightful death would have been,&mdash;never to see you
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine withdrew herself suddenly from her father&rsquo;s arms, put her two hands
      on the old man&rsquo;s shoulders, and looked at him with a bewildered air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for him,&rdquo; said the baron, cordially pressing in his own hands the
      hand of Erebus, who had stepped forward, gazing with admiration on the
      beauty of Reine, &ldquo;but for this young man, but for his courageous
      sacrifice, I should have been dashed to pieces in this gulf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few words the old man told his daughter and Honorât de Berrol how the
      stranger had saved him from certain death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times during this recital the blue eyes of Reine met the black eyes
      of Erebus; if she slowly turned her glance away to fix it on her father
      with adoration, it was not because the manner of this young man was bold
      or presumptuous; on the contrary, a tear moistened his eyes, and his
      charming face expressed the most profound emotion. He contemplated this
      pathetic scene with a sublime pride. When the old man opened his arms to
      him with paternal affection, he threw himself into them with inexpressible
      delight, pressed him many times to his heart, as if he had been attracted
      to the old gentleman by a secret sympathy, as if this young heart, still
      noble and generous, had anticipated the throbs of another noble and
      generous heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Trimalcyon and Pog, who, twenty steps distant, had witnessed this
      scene from the height of the rock where they were resting, cried out to
      their young companion some words in a foreign language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus started, the baron, his daughter, and Honorât de Berrol turned
      their heads quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon looked at the baron&rsquo;s daughter with a sort of vulgar and
      sneering admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange physiognomy of these two men surprised the baron, while his
      daughter and Honorât regarded them with an instinctive terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      A skilful painter would have found wealth of material in this scene.
      Imagine a profound solitude in the midst of tremendous rocks of reddish
      granite, whose summit only was lighted by the last rays of the sun. On the
      first plane, almost on the edge of the torrent bed, the baron with his
      left arm around Reine, grasping in his right hand the hand of Erebus, and
      fixing an anxious, surprised look on Pog and Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two, on the second plane, the other side of the golf, standing up
      side by side, with their arms crossed, outlining a characteristic
      silhouette upon the azure sky, distinctly perceptible across the ragged
      edges of the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, a few steps from the baron, stood Honorât de Berrol, holding his
      horse and Reine&rsquo;s nag, and farther still the two servants, one of whom was
      occupied in readjusting the harness of Mistraon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first words of the strangers, the beautiful features of Erebus
      expressed a sort of distressed impatience; he seemed to be undergoing an
      inward struggle; his face, which awhile ago was radiant with noble
      passions, gradually grew sombre, as if he were submitting to a mysterious
      and irresistible influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Trimalcyon, in a shrill and bantering voice, again uttered a few
      words, as he designated Reine by an insolent glance, when the lord Pog had
      added a biting sarcasm in the same language, unintelligible to the other
      actors in this scene, the features of Erebus completely changed their
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an almost disdainful gesture, he roughly repulsed the hand of the old
      man, and fixed an impudent stare on Mlle, des Anbiez. This time the girl
      blushed and dropped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden metamorphosis in the manners of the stranger was so striking
      that the baron recoiled a step. Nevertheless, after a silence of a few
      seconds, he said to Erebus, in a voice deeply moved:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I acknowledge, sir, the service you have just rendered me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; added Reine, overcoming the peculiar emotion which the last
      look on the part of Erebus had inspired, &ldquo;how shall we ever be able to
      prove our gratitude to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By giving me a kiss, and this pin as a remembrance of you,&rdquo; replied the
      impudent young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely uttered these words, when his mouth touched Reine&rsquo;s
      virginal lips, and his bold hand tore away the little pin enamelled with
      silver, which was fastened in the young girl&rsquo;s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this double larceny, Erebus, with wonderful agility, again cleared
      the gulf behind him, and rejoined his companions, with whom he soon
      disappeared behind a mass of rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine&rsquo;s fright and emotion were so violent that she turned deathly pale,
      her knees gave way, and she fell fainting in the arms of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day after this scene, the three Muscovites took leave of the
      marshal, Duke of Vitry, departed from Marseilles with their attendants,
      and proceeded on their way to Languedoc.

      CHAPTER III. THE WATCHMAN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The gulf of La Ciotat, equally distant from Toulon and Marseilles, lies in
      between the two capes of Alon and l&rsquo;Aigle. The latter rises on the west of
      the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      By order of the council of the town of La Ciotat, a sentry-box for the use
      of a watchman had been erected on the summit of this promontory. It was
      the duty of this man to watch for the coming of pirates from Barbary, and
      to signal their approach by kindling a fire which could be seen all along
      the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene we are about to describe occurred at the foot of this sentry-box
      about the middle of the month of December, 1633.
    </p>
    <p>
      An impetuous northwest wind, the terrible <i>mistraon</i> of Provence, was
      blowing with fury. The sun, half-obscured by great masses of gray clouds,
      was slowly sinking in the waves, whose immense dark green curve was broken
      by a wide zone of reddish light, which diminished in proportion as the
      black clouds extended over the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summit of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle, where the watchman&rsquo;s box was situated,
      commanded the entire circumference of the gulf; the last limestone spurs
      of the whitish mountains of Sixfours, and Notre Dame de la Garde,
      descending like an amphitheatre to the edge of the gulf, here joined
      themselves to little cliffs formed of fine white sand, which, lifted up by
      the south wind, invaded a part of the coast. A little farther, on the
      declivity of a series of hills, shone the lights of several quicklime
      ovens, whose black smoke increased the gloomy aspect of the sky. Almost at
      the foot of the cape of l&rsquo;Aigle, at the entrance of the bay, backed up
      against the mountains, could be seen, as the crow flies, the island Verte
      and the little town La Ciotat, belonging to the diocese of Marseilles and
      the jurisdiction of Aix.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town formed almost a trapezium, the base of which rested on the port
      This port held a dozen small vessels, called polacres and caravels, laden
      with wines and oil, waiting for favourable weather to return to the coast
      of Italy. About thirty boats designed for sardine fishing, called <i>essanguis</i>
      by the inhabitants of Provence, were moored in a little bay of the gulf,
      named the cove of La Fontaine. The belfries of the churches and of the
      convent of the Ursulines were the only things which broke the monotony of
      the dwellings, almost entirely covered with tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the hillsides which commanded the town, fields of olive-trees could be
      seen, several clusters of green oak and hillocks of vines, and at the
      extreme horizon the pine-covered summits of the chain of Roquefort
      mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the eastern limit of the bay of La Ciotat, between the points
      Carbonières and Seques, the ancient Roman ruins, called Torrentum, could
      be distinguished, and farther and farther toward the north several
      windmills, thrown here and there upon the heights, served as seamarks to
      the vessels which came to anchor in the gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, and west of the cape of L&rsquo;Aigle, almost upon the edge of the sea,
      rose a fortified mansion named Les Anbiez, of which we will speak later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summit of the cape of L&rsquo;Aigle formed a tableland fifty feet in
      circumference. Almost everywhere was the same precipitous rock of
      yellowish sandstone, variegated with brown; sea-broom, heather, and clover
      crossed it here and there; the watchman&rsquo;s sentry-box was erected under the
      cover of two stunted oaks and a gigantic pine, which had braved the fury
      of the tempests for two or three centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wind was very violent, although the promontory was more than
      three hundred feet above the level of the sea, one could hear the
      muttering thunder of the surf, as the waves broke themselves against its
      base.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman&rsquo;s box, solidly built of large blocks of stone, was covered
      over with slabs taken from the same quarry, so that the massive
      construction was able to resist the most violent winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal opening of this cabin looked toward the south, and from it
      the horizon was completely in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the door was a wide and deep square kiln, made of iron grating placed
      on layers of masonry. This kiln was kept filled with vine branches and
      fagots of olive-wood, ready to produce a tall and brilliant flame, which
      could be seen at a great distance. The furniture of this cabin was very
      poor, with the exception of a carved ebony casket, ornamented with the
      coat of arms and the cross of Malta, which treasure contrasted singularly
      with the modest appearance of this little habitation. A walnut chest
      contained a few marine books, quite eagerly sought after by the learned of
      our day, among others &ldquo;The Guide of the Old Harbour Pilot&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Torch
      of the Sea.&rdquo; From the rough lime-plastered walls hung a cutlass, a
      battle-axe, and a wheel-lock musket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two coarse, illuminated engravings, representing St. Elmo, the patron of
      mariners, and the portrait of the grand master of the hospitable order of
      St. John of Jerusalem, then existing, were nailed above the ebony casket.
      To conclude the inventory of furniture, on the floor near the fireplace,
      where a large log of olive wood was slowly burning, a rush matting,
      covered over with an old Turkish carpet, formed a moderately good bed, for
      the inhabitant of this isolated retreat was not wholly indifferent to
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman on the cape of L&rsquo;Aigle was attentively examining all the
      points of the horizon, with the aid of a Galileo spy-glass, at that time
      known by the name of long-view. The setting sun pierced the thick curtain
      of clouds, and with its last rays gilded the red trunk of the tall pine,
      the rough ridges of the little cabin walls, and the corners of the brown
      rock upon which the watchman was leaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm, intelligent face of this man was now lighted with intense
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      His complexion, burned by the wind and tanned by the sun, was the colour
      of brick, and here and there showed deep wrinkles. The hood of his
      long-sleeved mantle, hiding his white hair, shaded his black eyes and
      eyebrows; his long, gray moustache fell considerably below his lower lip,
      where it mingled with a heavy beard, which covered the whole of his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A red and green woollen girdle fastened his sailor trousers around his
      hips; straps supported his leather gaiters above his knees; a bag of
      richly embroidered stuff, hanging from his belt by the side of a long
      knife in its sheath, contained his tobacco, while his cachim-babaou, or
      long Turkish pipe with an earthen bowl, lay against the outer wall of his
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten years Bernard Peyrou had been watchman on the cape of L&rsquo;Aigle. He
      had recently been elected assignee of the overseer fishers of La Ciotat,
      who held their session every Sunday when there was matter for
      consideration. The watchman had served as patron seaman on the galleys of
      Malta for more than twenty years, never in all his navigations having left
      the Commander Pierre des Anbiez, of the venerable nation of Provence, and
      brother of Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, who lived on the coast in the
      fortified house of which we have spoken. On each of these voyages to
      France the commander never failed to visit the watchman. Their interviews
      lasted a long time, and it was observed that the habitual melancholy of
      the commander increased after these conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou, a lifelong sufferer from serious wounds, and unfit for active
      service on the sea, had been, at the recommendation of his old captain,
      chosen watchman by the council of the town of La Ciotat. When on Sunday he
      presided at the consultation of the overseers, an experienced sailor
      supplied his place at the sentry-box. Naturally endowed with a sense of
      right and justice, and living ten years in solitude, between the sky and
      the sea, Peyrou had added much to his intelligence by meditation. Already
      possessing the nautical and astronomical knowledge necessary to an officer
      on a galley of the seventeenth century, he continued to learn by a
      constant study of the great phenomena of nature always before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to his experience, and his habit of comparing cause and effect, no
      one knew better than himself how to predict the beginning, the duration,
      and the end of the storms which prevailed on the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He announced the calm and the tempest, the disastrous hurricanes of the <i>mistraon</i>,
      as the northwester was named in Provence, the gentle, fruitful rains of
      the <i>miegion</i>, or south wind, and the violent tornado of the <i>labechades</i>,
      or wind from the southwest; in fact, the form of the clouds, the soft or
      brilliant azure of the sky, the various colours of the sea, and all those
      vague, deep, and undefined noises which occasionally spring up in the
      midst of the silence of the elements were for him so many evident signs,
      from which he deduced the most infallible conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never a captain of a merchantman, never a cockswain of a bark, put to sea
      without having consulted Master Peyrou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men ordinarily surround with a sort of superstitious reverence and halo
      those who live apart from the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou was no exception to the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his predictions about the weather were almost invariably realised, the
      inhabitants of La Ciotat and the environs soon persuaded themselves that a
      man who knew so much of the things in the sky could not be ignorant of the
      things on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without passing exactly as a sorcerer, the hermit of the cape of L&rsquo;Aigle,
      consulted in so many important circumstances, became the depositary of
      many secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dishonest man would have cruelly abused this power, but Peyrou took
      advantage of it to encourage, sustain, and defend the good, and to accuse,
      confound, and intimidate the wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A practical philosopher, he felt that his opinion, his predictions, and
      his threats would lose much if their authority was not supported by a
      certain cabalistic display; hence, although he did so with reluctance, he
      accompanied each opinion with a mysterious formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excellent spy-glass was a marvellous aid to his power of divination.
      Not only did he turn it to the horizon in order to discover the chebecs
      and piratical vessels of Barbary, but he directed it to the little town of
      La Ciotat,&mdash;on the houses, the fields, and the beach,&mdash;and thus
      surprised many secrets and mysteries, and by this means increased the
      reverence he inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou, however, was altogether above the vulgar sorcerer by his entire
      disinterestedness. Had he some honest poverty to befriend, he ordered one
      of his wealthier clients to put a moderate offering in some secret spot
      which he indicated; the poor client, informed by Peyrou, went to the spot
      and found the mysterious alms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instigated by a blind zeal, the priests of the diocese of Marseilles
      wished to criminate the mysterious life of Peyrou, but the surrounding
      population immediately assumed such a menacing attitude, and the town
      council bore such testimony to the excellence of the watchman&rsquo;s character,
      that he was permitted to live his solitary life in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      His only companion in this profound retreat was a female eagle which, two
      years before, had come to lay her eggs in one of the hollows of the
      inaccessible rocks which bordered the coast. The male bird had no doubt
      been killed, as the watchman never saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou gave food to the young eagles; by degrees the mother grew
      accustomed to the sight of him, and the year after, she returned in
      perfect confidence to lay in the nest which Peyrou had prepared for her in
      a neighbouring rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the eagle perched on the branches of the tall pine which shaded the
      watchman&rsquo;s house, and sometimes walked with a heavy and awkward step on
      the little platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that day, Brilliant, for so the watchman had named the noble bird,
      seduced him from his reverie. She tumbled down from the topmost branch of
      the pine, and with half-open wings ran up to her friend with the
      ungraceful, waddling gait of a bird, of prey. Her plumage, black and brown
      on the wings, was ash-coloured and spotted with white on the body and
      neck; her formidable talons, covered with thick and shining scales,
      terminated in three claws and a sharp spur of smooth, black horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brilliant looked up at the watchman, lifting high her flat, gray head,
      where glittered two bold round eyes, whose iris dilated in a transparent
      cornea, the colour of topaz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her beak, strong and bluish like burnished steel, disclosed, when it
      opened, a slender tongue of pale red.
    </p>
    <p>
      To attract the watchman&rsquo;s attention, the eagle gently bit the end of his
      shoe, made of fawn leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou stooped and caressed Brilliant, who ruffled her feathers and
      uttered a discordant and broken cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, hearing a step in the narrow foot-path which led to the
      cabin, the eagle lifted herself, uttered a long barking cry, stretched her
      powerful wings, hovered a moment over the colossal pine, and like an arrow
      shot into space. Soon nothing could be seen but a black spot on the deep
      blue sky.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. STEPHANETTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A young girl with light complexion, black eyes, white teeth, and a bright
      and mischievous smile, appeared, and stopped a moment on the last step of
      the stair of rocks which led to the house of the watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore the graceful and picturesque costume of the girls of Provence: a
      brown petticoat and red waist, with wide basques and tight sleeves. Her
      little felt hat left visible the beautiful nape of her neck and long
      tresses of black hair rolled under a scarlet silk net.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orphan and foster-sister to Mlle. Reine des Anbiez, Stephanette served her
      in the duties of a companion, and was treated more as a friend than a
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette&rsquo;s heart was good, true, and grateful, her conduct
      irreproachable. Her only fault was a mischievous village coquetry, which
      was the despair of the fishers and captains of small craft in the gulf of
      La Ciotat, nor will we except from the number of these interesting victims
      her betrothed, Captain Luquin Trinquetaille, captain of the polacre, <i>Holy
      Terror to the Moors, by the Grace of God</i>,&mdash;a long and significant
      appellation, inscribed at full length on the stern of Captain
      Trinque-taille&rsquo;s boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallantly armed with six swivel-guns, it was the business of the polacre
      to escort vessels from La Ciotat which, forced by their commerce to have
      free intercourse with the coasts of Italy, dreaded the attacks of pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette shared the veneration that the watchman on the cape of l&rsquo;Aigle
      inspired among the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. She trembled as she
      approached him with downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God keep you, my child!&rdquo; said Peyrou, affectionately, for he loved
      her as he loved all who belonged to the family of his old captain, the
      Commander des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May St. Magnus and St. Elzear aid you, Master Peyrou!&rdquo; replied
      Stephanette, with her most beautiful curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your good wishes, Stephanette. How are monseigneur and
      Mlle. Reine, your young and beautiful mistress? Has she recovered from her
      fright of the other day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Peyrou; mademoiselle is better, although she is still quite
      pale. But was ever such a miscreant seen? To dare kiss mademoiselle! and
      that, too, in the presence of monseigneur and her betrothed! But people
      say these Muscovites are barbarians. They are more savage and more of
      Antichrist than the Turks themselves, are they not, Master Peyrou? They
      will be damned twice in a doubly hot fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without replying to Stephanette&rsquo;s theological argument, the watchman said
      to her: &ldquo;Does not monseigneur resent this breach of good manners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! Why, Master Peyrou, as true as Rosseline is a saint in Paradise, the
      same day that monseigneur came so near falling into the chasm of
      Ollioules, he supped as merrily as if he had just returned from a patronal
      feast. Indeed, it is so,&mdash;and he drank two cups of Spanish wine to
      the health of the young miscreant! And would you believe it, Master
      Peyrou, he is never tired of boasting of the courage and agility of the
      Muscovite! Yes, he said: &lsquo;Manjour! instead of stealing the pin and kiss
      like a thief, why did he not ask for them,&mdash;my daughter Reine would
      have given him a kiss, and with a good heart too!&rsquo; And ever since that day
      monseigneur is constantly saying, &lsquo;Really, these Muscovites are strange
      companions.&rsquo; But for all that, M. Honorât de Berrol turns red with
      indignation whenever he hears this impudent fellow, who stole a kiss from
      his betrothed, mentioned. And another strange thing, Master Peyrou, is
      that monseigneur is not willing to get rid of that wicked little horse,
      Mistraon, that has been the cause of all the mischief; he rides it in
      preference to any other. Now say, Master Peyrou, don&rsquo;t you think that is
      tempting Providence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have these strangers departed from Marseilles?&rdquo; asked the watchman,
      without replying to Stephanette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Peyrou, they say they have taken the route to Languedoc,
      after having made a visit to the Marshal of Vitry. They say, too, that
      this wicked duke is quite worthy of being acquainted with such rascals.
      Ah, if monseigneur had his way, the marshal would not be governor of
      Provence very long. The baron cannot hear him mentioned without flying
      into a passion,&mdash;such a passion! you have no idea of it, Master
      Peyrou.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, my child, I have seen the baron, at the time of the revolt
      of the Cascabeoux, act as his father did at the time of the revolt of the
      Razats, under Henry III., and again at the time of the rebellion of the
      Gascons against the Duke d&rsquo;Epemon, under the last reign. Yes, yes; I know
      that Raimond V. hates his enemies as much as he loves his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Master Peyrou, and monseigneur&rsquo;s anger against the
      governor has increased since this recorder of the admiralty of Toulon,
      Master Isnard, who they say is so wicked, has been visiting the castles of
      the diocese by order of his Eminence, the cardinal. Monseigneur says these
      visits are an outrage upon the nobility, and that the Marshal of Vitry is
      a scoundrel. Between us, I am of the same opinion, since he protects
      shameless Muscovites who have the insolence to kiss young girls when they
      are not expecting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is, Stephanette, that you are very severe upon young men who
      kiss young girls,&rdquo; said the old man with mock gravity, &ldquo;which proves that
      you are naturally ferocious,&mdash;but what do you want of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Peyrou,&rdquo; said the girl, with an air of embarrassment, &ldquo;I want to
      know if the weather promises a good passage to Nice, and if one could
      leave this port with safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish, then, to go to Nice, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not I exactly, but a brave and honest sailor who&mdash;who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand, I understand,&rdquo; said the watchman, interrupting
      Stephanette&rsquo;s stammering; &ldquo;you mean young Bernard, patron of the tartan,
      the <i>Sacred Balm</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Master Peyrou, I assure you I do not mean him,&rdquo; said the girl,
      turning as red as a cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, you need not blush like that,&rdquo; and the watchman added, in a
      lower tone: &ldquo;Was the beautiful bouquet of green thyme, that he tied three
      days ago to your window bar with rose coloured ribbon, to your taste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bouquet of green thyme! What bouquet are you talking about, Master
      Peyrou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The watchman held up a threatening finger to Stephanette and said: &ldquo;What!
      last Thursday, at daybreak, did not the patron Bernard carry a bouquet to
      your window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&mdash;let me see, Master Peyrou,&rdquo; said the young girl, with an air
      of recalling something to her memory; &ldquo;was it then yesterday that, in
      opening my casement, I found something like a bundle of dried herbs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanette, Stephanette! you cannot deceive the old watchman. Listen;
      patron Bernard had hardly descended, when you came and untied the rose
      coloured ribbon, and put the bouquet in a pretty terra-cotta vase, and you
      have watered it every morning; yesterday was the only day you neglected
      it, and it has withered&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl stared at the watchman in utter amazement. This revelation
      seemed like sorcery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked at her with a mischievous expression, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is not the patron Bernard who is going to Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Master Peyrou.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then it must be the pilot Terzarol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pilot Terzarol!&rdquo; cried Stephanette, clasping her hands, &ldquo;may Our Lady
      help me, if I know anything about this pilot going to sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my child, I was mistaken about Bernard, for it is true that
      you have allowed his bouquet to wither, but I am not mistaken about
      Terzarol, because yesterday, from the height of the castle turret, you
      passed more than two hours looking at the bold pilot throwing nets.&rdquo; &ldquo;I,
      Master Peyrou, I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very self, Stephanette, and at each cast of the net, Terzarol waved
      his cap in triumph, and you waved your handkerchief in congratulation; he
      ought to have made a good haul, so enthusiastically did he labour,&mdash;you
      come then to ask me if Terzarol will have a good voyage to Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Stephanette began to feel afraid, as she realised how much the
      watchman knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my faith, Master Peyrou, you know everything!&rdquo; cried she, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled, shook his head, and replied in the words of the
      Provencal proverb, &ldquo;<i>Experienco passo scienco</i>,&mdash;experience
      passes science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor child, fearing that the watchman&rsquo;s marvellous discoveries
      concerning her innocent coquetry might give him a bad opinion of her,
      cried, with tears in her eyes, as she clasped her hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Master Peyrou, I am an honest girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, my child,&rdquo; said the watchman, pressing her hand
      affectionately. &ldquo;I know that you are worthy of the protection and
      affection which your noble and kind mistress shows you. It is only girlish
      mischief and love of fun which tempts you to turn the heads of these young
      men, and make poor Luquin Trinquetaille jealous, Luquin, who loves you so
      much and so faithfully. But listen, Stephanette, you know the proverb of
      the vinedressers in our valleys: <i>Paou vignose ben tengudos</i>,&mdash;have
      few vines and cultivate them well. Instead of scattering your coquetries,
      concentrate all your charms upon your betrothed, who will prove a good and
      honest husband for you,&mdash;that would be far better,&mdash;and then,
      you see, my child, these young men are quick, inflammable, and courageous;
      self-love comes in, rivalry exasperates, a combat follows, blood flows,
      and then&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, Master Peyrou, then I should die of despair. All of
      this is folly. I was wrong, I admit, to amuse myself with the admiring
      glances of Bernard and Terzarol, for I love Luquin and he loves me; we are
      going to be married the same day as Mlle, and M. Honorât de Berrol,&mdash;the
      baron desires it. Really, Master Peyrou, you, who find out everything,
      ought to know that I think of nobody but Luquin. It is about his voyage
      that I have come to consult you. Master Talebard-Talebardon, consul of La
      Ciotat, is about to send to Nice three tartans laden with merchandise. He
      has made a bargain with Luquin to escort them; do you think, Master
      Peyrou, the passage will be good? Can he put to sea with safety? Is there
      no pirate in sight? Oh, if a corsair is in sight, or a storm threatens, he
      will not depart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so, so, my child, do you think you have so much influence over this
      bold artilleryman? You are mistaken, I think. What! keep him in port when
      there is danger in going out? You might as well try to anchor a ship with
      a thread from your distaff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, be quiet, Master Peyrou,&rdquo; said Stephanette, regaining her composure;
      &ldquo;to keep Luquin near me, I need not tell him of winds or tempests or of
      pirates. I will only tell him that I will give Bernard a ribbon to put on
      his lance at the next tilting-match, or that I will ask the pilot Terzarol
      for a good place at one of the windows of his mother&rsquo;s house, that I may
      go with Dulceline, the housekeeper at Maison-Forte, to see the wrestling
      and leaping over the cross-bar in La Ciotat; then, I swear to you, Master
      Peyrou, Luquin will not go out of the gulf, not if the consul,
      Talebard-Talebardon, covered the deck of his polacre with pieces of
      silver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what a cunning gipsy you are!&rdquo; said the old man, smiling. &ldquo;I would
      never have thought of such tricks. Alas, alas! <i>Buou viel fa rego drecho</i>,&mdash;the
      old ox makes a straight furrow. But come, now, Stephanette, make yourself
      easy; you need not rob your waist of a ribbon for Bernard nor ask for a
      window at the Terzarol house: the wind blows from the west, and if it does
      not change at sunset, and if Martin-Bouffo, the deep grotto of roaring
      waters in the gulf, says nothing tomorrow at daybreak Luquin will be able
      to go out of the gulf and sail for Nice without fear; as to the passage, I
      will answer for that; as to the pirates, I am going to give you a charm
      that is sure in its effect, if not to confuse them entirely, at least to
      prevent their carrying off the <i>Holy Terror to the Moors, by the Grace
      of God.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how thankful I will be, Master Peyrou!&rdquo; said the young girl, as she
      assisted him to rise, for he walked with considerable pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man went into his cabin, took a little bag covered with cabalistic
      signs and gave it to Stephanette, instructing her to order Luquin to
      conform scrupulously to the directions he would find in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are, Master Peyrou! How shall I reward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By promising me, my child, henceforth to allow Bernard&rsquo;s bouquets to dry
      on the bars of your window,&mdash;then, believe me, there will be no more
      of them, because a bouquet that is watered makes many others grow. Ah! and
      you must promise me, too, not to encourage pilot Terzarol&rsquo;s fishing,
      because to please you he would destroy all the fish in the bay, and he
      would finish by being called before the overseer fishers, and I would be
      obliged to condemn him. By the way, how goes on the discussion between
      monseigneur and the consuls, on the right of fishing in the cove,&mdash;does
      Raimond V. still keep his seines there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Peyrou, and he will not take them away; he says that the
      right of fishing there belongs to him up to the rocks of Castrembaou, and
      that he will not yield that right to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Stephanette: your mistress has her father&rsquo;s ear; do you persuade
      her to counsel him to arrange it amicably with the consuls: that will be
      the best for all parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Peyrou, make yourself easy about it, I will mention it to
      Mlle. Reine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my child,&mdash;good-bye, and above all, no more coquetry,&mdash;do
      you promise me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Peyrou, only&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, say it&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, you see, Master Peyrou, I would not like to make Bernard and
      Terzarol despair entirely,&mdash;not on my own account, Our Lady, no, but
      on account of Luquin, because I must have some means of keeping him in
      port, in case of great danger, you see, Master Peyrou,&mdash;and for that
      purpose, jealousy is worth more than all the anchors of his ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said the watchman, with a significant smile, &ldquo;you must
      think of Luquin above all things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl dropped her eyes and smiled, then said: &ldquo;Ah, I was about to
      forget, Master Peyrou, to ask you if you thought that monsieur, the
      commander, and the Reverend Father Elzear would arrive here for the
      Christmas holidays, as the baron hopes. He is so anxious to see his two
      brothers again&mdash;do you know that Christmas has been twice celebrated
      at Maison-Forte without them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of the commander, the face of the watchman took on an
      expression of profound melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If God grants my most earnest prayers, my child, they will both come,
      but, alas, Father Elzear has gone to redeem captives in Algiers, as a
      worthy and courageous brother of mercy, and the faith of those Barbary
      people is perfidious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Peyrou, as Father Elzear learned by experience when he was
      kept in the convict-prison among slaves for one year! At his age, too, to
      suffer so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And without a murmur,&mdash;without losing his adorable saintliness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of them, Master Peyrou, why is the commander&rsquo;s galley, instead
      of being white and gold like the gallant galleys of the king, and of
      monseigneur, the Duke of Guise, always painted in black like a coffin? Why
      are its sails and masts black? Really, nothing looks more solemn, and his
      sailors and his soldiers, they look as hard and severe as Spanish monks;
      and then the commander himself looks so sad. I never saw a smile on his
      pale face but once, and that was when he arrived at Maison-Forte and
      embraced monseigneur and my mistress. Yet, my God, what a melancholy
      smile! Is it not strange, Master Peyrou, and all the more so because
      Luquin told me, the other day, that when he was artilleryman on board <i>La
      Guisarde</i>, the admiral&rsquo;s galley, in the waters of the Levant, many a
      time he has seen the commanders and captains of Malta at Naples, and
      notwithstanding the severity of their order, they were as merry as other
      officers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The watchman for some moments seemed as if he no longer heard the girl;
      his head had fallen upon his breast, he was lost in profound meditation,
      and when Stephanette bade him farewell, he responded only by an
      affectionate gesture of the hand. Some time after the departure of the
      young girl, he went into his cabin, opened the carved ebony box he found
      there, sprung the secret lock of a double bottom, and took out of it a
      little casket chased with silver; an embassed Maltese cross ornamented its
      cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he gazed at this casket with sorrowful attention; the
      sight of it seemed to awaken the most bitter memories. Then, assuring
      himself that this mysterious trust was still intact, he shut the doors of
      the ebony chest and, like a dreamer, returned to his seat at the door of
      his cabin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE BETROTHED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stephanette left the watchman with a light heart She was just about to
      quit the esplanade, when she saw, on the last steps of the stairway, the
      tall figure of Captain Luquin Trinquetaille. With an imperative sign the
      young girl ordered him to return by the way he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor showed an exemplary submission; he stopped, made a right-about,
      with the quickness and precision of a German grenadier, and gravely
      descended the steps he had just mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the meeting been arranged by the lovers? We do not know, but certain
      it was that Stephanette, preceded by her obedient adorer, descended the
      narrow, winding flight of steps which conducted to the watchman&rsquo;s cabin,
      with the lightness of a gazelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times Luquin turned his head, to catch a sight of the neat ankle and
      little foot, which cleared the rough rocks so nimbly, but Stephanette,
      with a threatening gesture, and queen-like dignity, arrested the curiosity
      of the ex-artilleryman, who was compelled to accelerate his gait in
      obedience to the oft-repeated words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Luquin, go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the lovers are descending the escarpment of the cape of l&rsquo;Aigle, we
      will say a few words about Luquin Trinquetaille. He was a robust fellow of
      thirty years, brown and sunburnt. He had a manly figure, a frank,
      ingenuous manner, somewhat vain; he wore a costume which marked both the
      soldier and the sailor,&mdash;a military coat, and Provencal breeches,
      fastened around his waist by the belt which held his broadsword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was cold, and over his coat he wore a mantle, the seams of which
      were braided in red and blue wool; the hood half covered his forehead, and
      under it could be seen a forest of black curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had reached the foot of the mountain, Stephanette, in spite, of
      her agility, felt the need of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luquin, delighted with an opportunity for conversation, carefully sought a
      spot where she could be comfortably seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had found it, he gallantly took off his mantle and spread it out
      on the rock, so that Stephanette could have a seat with a back; then,
      crossing his hands on the head of his cane, and leaning his chin on his
      hands, he contemplated Stephanette with a calm and happy adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had recovered from the effects of her precipitous descent,
      Stephanette turned to Luquin, and said, with the air of a spoiled child,
      and a woman sure of her despotic domination:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Luquin, did you come to the watchman&rsquo;s cabin for me, when I told you
      to wait for me at the foot of the mountain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin, preoccupied with admiration for Stephanette&rsquo;s fine colour, which
      the walk had imparted, did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ever anybody see the like?&rdquo; cried she, with an impatient stamp of her
      little foot. &ldquo;Do you hear what I say to you, Luquin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the captain, coming out of his reflective mood; &ldquo;all that I
      know is that from Nice to Bayonne, from Bayonne to Calais, from Calais to
      Hambourg, from Hambourg to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished your European trip, Luquin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, from one pole to the other there is not a prettier girl than you,
      Stephanette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Did you make such an extensive voyage to arrive at that discovery,
      captain? I pity the privateers of the <i>Holy Terror to the Moors, by the
      Grace of God</i>, if the voyages of this poor old polacre have no better
      results!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak ill of my polacre, Stephanette; you will be glad to see its
      blue and white pavilion when I return from Nice, and how you will watch
      for my coming from the turret of Maison-Forte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin&rsquo;s conceitedness disgusted Stephanette; she replied, with an
      ironical air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! I see that a watchman on the cape of L&rsquo;Aigle is altogether
      unnecessary. All the young girls who wait impatiently for the return of
      Captain Trinque-taille, and all the jealous ones who watch his departure
      with their eyes fixed on the sea, will be sufficient to discover the
      pirates. There is nothing more to fear from corsairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin took on an air of modest triumph, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St. Stephen, my patron, I am too sure of your love, and too happy in
      it, Stephanette, to care if I am expected or regretted by other girls; and
      although Rose, the daughter of the haberdasher in La Ciotat,&mdash;who
      resembles the flower whose name she bears,&mdash;often tells me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith! Thank you for your confidences, Luquin,&rdquo; said Stephanette, with
      a jealous impatience she could not dissimulate. &ldquo;If I told you all that
      the patron Bernard or Master Terzarol said to me, it would take till
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Luquin frowned when he heard the names of his rivals, and
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder of heaven! If I knew that those two rascals dared even to look at
      your shoes as you pass, I would make a figurehead for my polacre of one,
      and a weather-cock for my mast of the other! But no! They know that Luquin
      Trinquetaille is your betrothed, and his name rhymes too well with battle
      for them to want an issue with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my fine bully!&rdquo; replied Stephanette, recalling the watchman&rsquo;s
      advice, and fearing to excite the jealousy of the inflammable captain; &ldquo;if
      Bernard and Terzarol talk to me ever so long, I shall reply that every one
      knows I am too much in love with the most wicked devil in La Ciotat But
      wait,&mdash;see here what Master Peyrou gave me for you. Read that, and do
      everything he orders. It is late; the sun is setting, and it is getting
      cold. Let us go back to Maison-Forte; mademoiselle will be anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two lovers hastened on their way, and, as they walked, Trinquetaille
      read the following instructions given by the watchman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every morning at sunrise the captain will change the charge of his
      cannon, and will put on the ball one of the red flies affixed to this
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that, make a double cross on the ball with the thumb of the left
      hand. From sunrise to sunset, cabin-boys must relieve each other on the
      watch at the top of the mast; they will always look at the east and the
      south, and every five minutes repeat &lsquo;St Magnus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set the swords in order on the stem, three by three, point downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set the muskets on the right of the deck, three by three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the day of departure, at the rising of the moon, carry on deck a vase
      filled with oil; throw in it seven grains of salt, saying with each grain
      &lsquo;St Elmo and St Peter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the vase on deck until the moon goes down. At that moment cover it
      over with a black veil, on which write in vermilion the word &lsquo;Syrakoe.&rsquo; 
      Every morning at sunrise, rub the arms and the locks of the muskets with
      this oil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point, Captain Trinquetaille stopped and said to Stephanette:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St. Elmo, Master Peyrou is a sorcerer. Three months ago, if I had had
      these flies of magic paper, my swivel-guns, instead of resting mute on
      their pivots when I applied the match, would have replied sharply to that
      Tunis chebec which surprised our convoy, and we did not see until it was
      almost on us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Luquin, do not your sentinels see at a distance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and if, while they were watching, they had said &lsquo;St. Magnus&rsquo; every
      five minutes, as Master Peyrou says in his sorcery, it is certain the
      virtue of St. Magnus would have prevented the pirates&rsquo; approach without
      being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would you have made use of this magic oil for the muskets, Luquin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, the day that my guns would not go off, I would have given
      all the oil which burns in the eternal lamp of the Chapel of Notre Dame de
      la Garde, for one drop of this oil with the seven grains of salt, and that
      formidable word &lsquo;Syrakoe&rsquo; written on the cover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, Luquin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My artillery was useless, and I wished to board the chebec with a grand
      reinforcement of musket-shot, but as wicked fate would have it, the arms
      were below, and the locks of the muskets were rusty; you see, then,
      Stephanette, if we had arranged the arms on deck, three by three, and had
      rubbed the musket locks with this magic oil of Syrakoe, we would have been
      able to resist, and perhaps capture this pirate chebec instead of flying
      before it, like a cloud of sparrows from a hawk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to see that, under these mysterious and cabalistic formulæ, the
      watchman on the cape of L&rsquo;Aigle gave the best practical advice, and
      endeavoured to restore such nautical precautions and practices as had,
      through negligence or want of care, fallen into disuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red flies, placed every morning on the balls with a sign of the cross,
      had no doubt a very negative virtue, but to perform this magical
      operation, it was necessary to change the charge of the artillery, often
      damaged by the water of the sea, which swept the deck, and thus the powder
      was kept dry and the guns ready for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The counsel of the watchman, followed exactly, prevented serious disaster,
      whether it pertained to the oil of Syrakoe, or the cries of &ldquo;St Magnus,&rdquo;
       or the arms arranged three by three on the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      In looking steadily toward the east and the south, points of crossing by
      the pirates, the sentinels of course could give warning of their approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      In invoking St. Magnus every five minutes, they would not run the risk of
      sleeping at their posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, it was important to have always on deck arms in good condition
      and readiness. The watchman accomplished this by ordering them to be
      arranged in stacks of three, and carefully rubbed with oil, which would
      preserve them from the inclemency of the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      In formulating his recommendations in cabalistic phrase, he assured the
      execution of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After renewed praises of the watchman&rsquo;s wisdom, Luquin and Stephanette
      arrived at Maison-Forte. Notwithstanding her air of gaiety, the young
      girl&rsquo;s heart was deeply pained at the thought of her lover&rsquo;s departure the
      next morning. Tears flowed down her cheeks; she extended her hand to
      Trinquetaille, and said, with a trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Luquin, every morning and evening I will pray God to keep you
      from meeting these wicked pirates. Oh, why do you not abandon this
      perilous calling, which gives me continual anxiety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, when I have gained enough, so that Mlle. Trinquetaille&rdquo;&mdash;only
      the nobility had the title of madame&mdash;&ldquo;need not envy the richest
      citizen of La Ciotat.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can you talk so, Luquin?&rdquo; said the young girl,
      reproachfully, as she wiped the tears from her eyes. &ldquo;What matters finery
      and a little more comfort to me, when you are risking your life every
      day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be distressed, Stephanette, the watchman&rsquo;s advice shall not be
      lost: with the help of St. Magnus, and the magic oil of Syrakoe, I can
      defy all the pirates of the regency. But, good-bye, Stephanette, good-bye,
      and think of Luquin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the worthy captain pressed Ste-phanette&rsquo;s white hands,
      and hurried away, lest he should betray the emotion which filled his
      heart, as if it were a thing unworthy of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl&rsquo;s eyes followed her lover as long as possible, and at
      nightfall she entered Maison-Forte, the home of Raimond V., Baron des
      Anbiez.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. MAISON-FORTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Maison-Forte, or Castle des Anbiez, stood upon the seashore. In the time
      of storm, the waves beat upon the terrace or rampart which stood out from
      the shore to protect the entrance into the port of La Ciotat, where were
      anchored a few fishing-boats, and the pleasure tartan of Raimond V., Baron
      des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the castle presented nothing remarkable. Built in the middle
      of the fifteenth century, its architecture, or rather its construction,
      was massive. Two towers with pointed roof flanked the main body of the
      dwelling exposed to the south, and commanding a view of the sea. Its thick
      walls, built of sandstone and granite, were of reddish gray colour, and
      were irregularly cut by a few windows, which resembled loopholes for
      cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only framed windows of a gallery, which ran across the entire length
      of the castle, on the first floor, were large and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of them opened upon a balcony ornamented with a beautiful grating of
      hammered iron, in the middle of which was carved the baron&rsquo;s coat of arms.
      The same coat of arms showed upon the entablature of the principal door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short flight of steps descended to the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessities of civil and religious war, at the end of the last
      century, and the constant fear of pirates, had altered this terrace into
      an armed and embattled rampart, parallel with the façade of the castle,
      and joined to the foot of the turrets by two sides of a right angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few old orange-trees with shining leaves testified to the ancient
      character of this esplanade, once a smiling flower garden, but two
      sentry-boxes for scouts, a few enclosures for cannon-balls, eight pieces
      of ordnance, two of which were mounted, and a long, turning culverin
      showed that Maison-Forte of the Baron des Anbiez was in a good state of
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of this castle was the more important as the little bay it
      commanded, as well as the Gulf of La Ciotat, offered the only place where
      vessels could anchor; the rest of the coast presenting a line of
      unapproachable rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The façade of the Castle des Anbiez which looked north, and the
      surrounding land, were very picturesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irregular buildings, added to the principal edifice according to the
      different requirements of successive proprietors, broke the monotony of
      its lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stables, dog-kennels, sheepfolds, commons, and lodgings for labourers
      and farmers, formed the enclosure of an immense court, planted with two
      rows of sycamores. This court was reached by a drawbridge over a wide and
      deep ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every evening this bridge was removed, and a heavy door of oak, strongly
      supported on the inside, put the little colony in safely for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every window of these buildings opened upon the court, with the exception
      of a few dormer windows, solidly protected by iron grating, which looked
      out upon the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maison-Forte counted about two hundred persons among its dependents,&mdash;servants,
      farmers, labourers, and shepherds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them were sixty men of from thirty to fifty years, accustomed to the
      use of arms during the civil wars in which the impetuous baron had taken
      part. Royalist and Catholic, Raimond V. had always mounted his horse when
      it was necessary to defend the ancient rights and possessions of Provence
      against governors or their deputies, for the kings of France were not
      kings of Provence, but counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intendants of justice or presidents of courts, whose office it was to
      collect the taxes, and to announce to the assembled states the assessment
      of voluntary gifts which Provence owed to the sovereign, were almost
      always the first victims of these revolts against royal authority, made
      with the cry of &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under such circumstances Raimond V. was among the first to rebel. In the
      last rebellion of Cascaveoux,&mdash;so named from the word <i>cascavoeu</i>,
      the Provençal for little bell, which the insurgents fastened to the end of
      a leather strap, and rang as they cried, &ldquo;Long live the king,&rdquo;&mdash;none
      sounded the battle-cry, and shook his bell more violently, or made his
      dependents shake this signal of revolt, with more enthusiastic ardour than
      Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that, the baron showed himself the worthy son of his father, Raimond
      IV., one of the gentlemen most seriously compromised in the rebellion of
      the Razats, which name originated from the fact that the Provençals had
      been as spoiled of their possessions as if a razor had been employed. This
      rebellion broke out under Henry III., in 1578, and was suppressed with
      great difficulty by Marshal de Retz.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron looked with great impatience upon the growth of the power of
      Cardinal Richelieu, at the expense of the royal authority, and the
      disappearance of the sovereign beneath the shadow of the prime minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar movements of resistance manifested themselves in Languedoc and in
      Provence, in favour of Gaston of Orleans, brother of Louis XIII., whom the
      royalist faction opposed to the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that the baron would never have taken an active part in
      these intrigues, but for the apprehension caused by the pirates along the
      coast, but, compelled to concentrate his forces in order to defend his
      house and estate, he declaimed violently against the cardinal, especially
      since the latter had given the government of Provence to the Marshal of
      Vitry.
    </p>
    <p>
      These important functions had, up to that time, been filled by the Duke of
      Guise, admiral of the Levant, who, to the great delight of the Provençals,
      after many obstacles, had replaced the Duke d&rsquo;Epernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lion has devoured the old bear,&rdquo; said Cæsar of Nostradamus on
      this subject at the celebration of the nomination of the young Lorraine
      prince for this important post.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Marshal of Vitry was promoted to the position of Governor of
      Provence, the nobility gave vent to their indignation, because a member of
      the house of Lorraine was not considered worthy of this dignity, usually
      reserved for a prince of the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Louis Gallucio, marquis, was Duke of Vitry, it was remarked that the
      Cardinal de Retz, without otherwise blaming him for having been one of the
      murderers of the Marshal of Ancre, said simply of him: &ldquo;He had little
      sense, but he was bold to temerity, and the part he had in the murder of
      the Marshal of Ancre gave him, in the eyes of the world, a certain air of
      business and execution.&rdquo; This speech gives us an idea of the times and
      manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron des Anbiez, notwithstanding his fondness for independence and
      rebellion, was the best and most generous of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adored by the peasants of his domain, and revered by the inhabitants of
      the little town of La Ciotat, who always found him ready to direct their
      troops and aid them with all his power to defend themselves from the
      pirates, he exercised a powerful influence throughout the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, his vigorous opposition to several orders of the Marshal of
      Vitry, which seemed to him to aim a blow at the rights of Provence, had
      been highly and generally approved in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Stephanette returned to Maison-Forte, the sun was just setting. The
      first care of the young girl was to go to Mlle. Reine des Anbiez. Reine
      was accustomed to occupy a chamber situated on the first floor of one of
      the turrets of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This room was round in shape, serving her as a cabinet for study, and was
      furnished with great care and expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron, loving his daughter to idolatry, had devoted to the interior
      arrangement of this room a considerable sum. The circular walls were
      covered with rich Flemish tapestry of deep green, with designs of a darker
      shade, enwrought with threads of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other pieces of furniture was a walnut bookcase, curiously carved in
      the style of the renaissance, and encrusted with Florentine mosaic. A
      rich, thick Turkey carpet covered the floor. The spaces separating the
      beams of the ceiling were of azure blue, studded with arabesques of gold
      of delicate workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silver lamp was suspended from the main girder by a chain of silver. The
      form of these lamps, still used in some villages of Provence, was very
      simple. They were made of a square of metal, the edges of which, an inch
      in height, contained the oil, and formed a sort of beak at each angle from
      which issued the wicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a table with curved legs placed in the embrasure of the window lay a
      lute, a theorbo, and some pieces of unfinished tapestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two portraits, one of a woman, the other of a man, in the costume of the
      reign of Henry III., were placed above this table, and lit up by oblique
      rays through little windows in leaden frames, which were set in the long
      and narrow casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To supply the want of a chimney a large copper coal-pan, curiously carved,
      and supported by four massive claws, stood in a corner of the room. It
      contained a bed of ashes and some embers, upon which were smoking some
      sprigs of fragrant broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine des Anbiez wore a dress of heavy brown Tours silk, with a train, and
      tight waist and sleeves; her cheeks were flushed, and her features
      expressed not surprise only but fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seized her waiting-woman by the hand, and conducted her to the table,
      and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The object to which she called the attention of Stephanette was a little
      vase of rock crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its long and slender neck issued an orange-coloured lily, with an
      azure blue calyx, in which stood pistils of silvery whiteness. This
      brilliant flower exhaled a delicious odour which resembled the mingled
      perfume of vanilla, lemon, and jessamine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mademoiselle, what a beautiful flower! Is it a present from the
      Chevalier de Berrol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of her betrothed&rsquo;s name, Reine turned pale and red by
      turns; then, without replying to Stephanette, she took up the vase with a
      sort of fear, and showed her a beautifully enamelled figure which she had
      discovered there, and the representation of a white dove with a
      rose-coloured beak, and extended wings, holding in its purplish bronze
      feet a branch of olive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Lady!&rdquo; screamed Stephanette in fright. &ldquo;It is the very picture of the
      enamelled pin that young miscreant robbed you of in the rocks of
      Ollioules, after he had saved monseigneur&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who brought this vase and flower here?&rdquo; asked Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine turned pale and made a sign in the affirmative. &ldquo;Holy Virgin, this
      must be sorcery!&rdquo; cried Stephanette, setting the vase back on the table as
      if it had burned her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine could scarcely control her emotion, but said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little while ago, when I went out to see my father mount his horse, I
      promenaded until nightfall in the great walk by the drawbridge, and when I
      returned I found this flower on this table. My first thought, like yours,
      was that Chevalier de Berrol had sent it or brought it, although such a
      flower in this season would be a miracle; I asked if the chevalier had
      arrived at Maison-Forte, and was told he had not; besides, I had the key
      of this apartment with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, mademoiselle, it must be magic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what to think. In examining the vase more attentively, I
      see the enamelled likeness of the pin that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine could not say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face and form betrayed the violent emotion which the memory of that
      strange day caused her, the day when the foreigner had dared approach his
      lips to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must consult the chaplain or the watchman, mademoiselle,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Stephanette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, be silent. Do not noise abroad this mystery which frightens me in
      spite of myself. Let us examine this apartment well; perhaps we may
      discover something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this flower, this vase, mademoiselle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a reply, Reine threw the flower in the coal-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It almost seemed that the poor flower turned itself in pain upon the
      burning coals; the light hissing produced by the water which oozed out
      from the stem, seemed like plaintive cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon it was in ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Reine opened the window which looked upon the esplanade, and threw
      out the crystal flagon. It broke with a noise upon the parapet, and its
      fragments fell into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment sounded heavy steps, and click of spurs upon the flagstones
      of the staircase. The hoarse voice of Raimond V. called joyously to his
      daughter to come and see&mdash;that demon of a Mistraon!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word of this to my father,&rdquo; said Reine to Stephanette, putting her
      finger on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she descended to meet the good old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE SUPPER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reine, hiding her emotion, joined her father. Raimond V. kissed his
      daughter&rsquo;s brow tenderly, then, taking her arm, descended the last steps
      of the staircase which led from the tower. He wore an old green military
      coat, braided with gold, somewhat tarnished, scarlet breeches, great boots
      of sheepskin covered with mud, and long spurs of rusty iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held his gray cap in his hand, and although the weather was quite cold,
      the wrinkled and sunburnt brow of Raimond V. was covered with sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of a torch, a valet, holding by the bridle the treacherous
      and obstreperous Mistraon, whose flanks were foaming with perspiration,
      could be seen in the court of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great black hunting dog with long hair, and a little yellow and white
      spaniel, were lying at the feet of the stallion from Camargne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog was panting; his ears lying on his head, his mouth open and filled
      with foam, his eyes half closed, and the feverish palpitation of his
      sides, all announced that he had just run a rapid race. The sight of
      Mistraon added to Reine&rsquo;s annoyance by recalling the scene on the rocks.
      But the baron, preoccupied by the success of the chase, had not the
      penetration to discover the agitation of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He detached a leather strap which held a large hare to the bow of his
      saddle, and proudly presented the game to Reine, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you believe it, Eclair,&rdquo; and at the name the dog lifted his fine
      intelligent head, &ldquo;caught this hare in thirteen minutes on the marshes of
      Savenol. It was old Genêt,&rdquo; and at this name the little spaniel lifted his
      head, &ldquo;that put him on the track. Mistraon is so fleet that I did not lose
      sight of Eclair from the time I began to climb the hill of black stones. I
      made, I am sure, more than a league and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, why will you ride this horse, after the frightful experience
      you have had with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manjour!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman, with an air of mock gravity, &ldquo;never
      shall it be said that Raimond V. succumbed to one of the indomitable sons
      of Camargne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my daughter, I yield no more on land than on sea, and I say that,
      because I have just been visiting the seines that those rascals in La
      Ciotat wish to prevent my laying beyond the rocks of Castrembaou. Just
      now, too, I met the consul Talebard-Talebardon on his nag, and he talked
      about it And he had the effrontery to threaten me with the tribunal of
      overseers, of which the watchman is the assignee! Manjour, I laughed so
      much, that this demon, Mistraon, took advantage of my distraction and flew
      like an arrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More dangers, father; this horse will be the death of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be easy, my child, although I have not such a vigorous fist as the half
      savage young Muscovite who so adroitly arrested Mistraon on the border of
      a precipice, the bridle and the spur and the whip know how to reason with
      a vicious horse and his pranks. But permit me, my beautiful lady of the
      castle, to offer you the foot of the animal that I have captured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the baron drew a knife from his pocket, cut off the right foot of the
      hare, and gallantly presented it to his daughter, who accepted, not
      without some repugnance, this trophy of the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistraon was led back to the stable, but Eclair and Genêt, favourites of
      the baron, followed him side by side, as, leaning on the arm of his
      daughter, he made what he called his evening inspection, while waiting for
      the hour of supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women and young girls were spinning at the wheel, the men mending
      their nets and cleaning implements of husbandry. Master Laramée, the old
      sergeant of the company raised by the baron during the civil troubles, and
      majordomo and commander of the castle garrison, exacted that all of the
      baron&rsquo;s tenants, who, in turn, performed the service of sentinel on the
      terrace which bordered the sea, should be armed in military style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others were engaged in decorating long lances, destined for jousts on the
      water, or to be used in jumping the cross-bar, the usual Christmas
      amusements, in the colours of the baron, red and yellow. Some, more
      seriously occupied, prepared the seed for late sowing; some were weaving,
      with great care, baskets out of rushes, to hold presents of fruit, made at
      Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      These occupations were enlivened by songs peculiar to the country,
      sometimes accompanied by some marvellous legend, or terrible recital of
      the cruelties of pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an upper hall filled with fruit, children and old men were busy in
      examining long garlands of grapes, which hung from the rafters of the
      ceiling, or packing in baskets sweet-smelling figs, dried upon layers of
      straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther on was the laundry, where the washerwomen, under the supervision
      of a gentlewoman, Dulceline, the housekeeper, were occupied in perfuming
      the linen of the castle, by putting between its folds, whiter than snow,
      the leaves of aromatic herbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the sharp voice of Dulceline rose above the songs of the
      washerwomen, as she reprimanded some idlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the side of the laundry was the pharmacy of the castle, where the
      peasants of the neighbourhood found all their remedies. This pharmacy
      belonged to the department of the baron&rsquo;s chaplain, Abbé Mascarolus, an
      old and excellent priest of angelic piety and rare simplicity. The
      chaplain had an extensive acquaintance with medical men and their
      attainments, and firmly believed in the strange pharmacy of that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the continual apprehension of a visit from the pirates, all
      the inhabitants of Maison-Forte shared the traditional gaiety, so to
      speak, which the approach of Christmas, the most joyous and most important
      festival of the year, always brought to Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every evening before supper, the baron made, in company with his daughter,
      what he called his inspection; that is, he went through the whole theatre
      of the various occupations with which we have been entertaining the
      reader, chatting familiarly with everybody, listening to requests and
      complaints, often impatient and sometimes flying into a passion and
      scolding, but always full of justice and kindness, and so cordial in his
      good-humour that his bursts of irritation were soon forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. kept a large part of his domain in good condition. He sat up a
      long time at night to talk with his principal shepherds, labourers,
      farmers, and vinedressers, convinced of the wisdom of the two Provençal
      proverbs, worthy of the watchman on the cape of l&rsquo;Aigle: <i>Luci doou
      mestre engraisso lou chivaou</i>,&mdash;the eye of the master fattens the
      horse. <i>Bouen pastre, bouen ave</i>,&mdash;good shepherd, good flock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman usually completed his circuit by a visit to the
      pharmacy, where he found Abbé Mascarolus, who gave him a sort of hygienic
      statement of the health of the inhabitants of the domain Des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, he passed by the laundry, going directly to the pharmacy,
      accompanied by Reine. Preparations for the Christmas holidays were going
      on all through the castle, but the most important solemnity of all was
      reserved for the care of the venerable Dulceline, who had entreated the
      abbé to enlighten her with his counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the cradle or crib, a sort of picture placed every Christmas day
      in the most beautiful room of the habitation,&mdash;castle, cottage, or
      mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This picture represented the birth of the infant Jesus; there were the
      stable, the ox, the ass, St Joseph, and the Virgin holding on her knees
      the Saviour of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every family, poor or rich, deemed it absolutely requisite to have a
      cradle as elegant as could be afforded, ornamented with garlands and
      tinsel, and illuminated with a circle of candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Raimond V. passed the laundry, he was surprised not to see Dulceline,
      and asked where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said a young girl with black eyes and cheeks the colour of
      a pomegranate, &ldquo;Mile. Dulceline is in the chamber of the philters, with
      the abbé and Thereson; she is at work on the cradle, and forbids us to
      enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said the baron, &ldquo;the supper-bell has rung, and the abbé must
      say grace for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced to the door; it was fastened on the inside; he knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, abbé, supper is ready, and I am as hungry as the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Dulceline, &ldquo;we cannot open,&mdash;it is a
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, abbé, you have secrets with Dulceline?&rdquo; said the old gentleman,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monseigneur, God save us! Thereson is with us,&rdquo; screamed the old
      lady, offended at the baron&rsquo;s pleasantry. As she opened the door, she
      presented a pale, wrinkled face, framed in a ruff and cap, worthy of the
      pencil of Holbein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé, fifty years old, was dressed in a black robe and cap, which fit
      his head closely and displayed his gentle face to advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereson, as soon as the baron entered, hid the cradle under a cloth. The
      baron approached, and was about to lift it, when Dulceline cried, in a
      beseeching tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monseigneur! permit us the pleasure of surprising you; rest assured
      this will be the most beautiful cradle that has ever adorned the great
      hall of Maison-Forte, and it ought to be, by Our Lady, since the commander
      and Father Elzear are coming such a distance to assist at the Christmas
      festivity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manjour! I shall be unhappy indeed if they do not come,&rdquo; said the baron:
      &ldquo;two years have passed since my brothers have spent a night or a day in
      our father&rsquo;s house, and by St. Bernard, my patron, who assists me, the
      Lord will grant us a reunion this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God will hear you, monseigneur, and I join my prayers to yours,&rdquo; said the
      abbé. Then he added: &ldquo;Monseigneur, did you have a successful hunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, abbé, see for yourself!&rdquo; and the baron took the hare&rsquo;s foot
      that Reine held in her hand, and showed it to the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If mademoiselle does not desire to keep this foot,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;I
      will ask her for it, for my pharmacy, and will monseigneur tell me if it
      is the right or the left foot of the animal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you going to do with it, abbé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said the good Mascarolus, pointing to an open volume on the
      table, &ldquo;I have just received this book from Paris. It is the journal of M.
      de Maucaunys, a very illustrious and learned man, and I read here, page
      317: &lsquo;Recipe for the gout. Lay against the thigh, between the trousers and
      the shirt, on the side affected, two paws of a hare killed between Lady
      Day of September and Christmas, but with the important restriction, that
      the hind left paw must be used if it is the right arm which is ailing, and
      the right fore paw if it is the leg or the left thigh which is ailing: on
      the instant the application is made, the pain will cease.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; cried the baron, laughing with all his might. &ldquo;This is a
      wonderful discovery; now the poachers will claim to be apothecaries, and
      they will catch hares only to cure the gout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good abbé, quite embarrassed by the sarcasms of the baron, continued
      to read to keep himself in countenance, and added: &ldquo;I see, baron, on page
      177, wood-lice, given to dropsical nightingales, will cure them entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the laughter of the good gentleman was more uproarious. Reine,
      notwithstanding her preoccupation, could not repress a smile, and finally
      laughed with her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbé Mascarolus smiled softly, and bore these innocent railleries with
      Christian resignation, and no longer tried to defend an empiricism which,
      no doubt, may find analogies in medical books of the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. took leave of the pharmacy to find pleasure elsewhere, when
      Laramée, majordomo and master of ceremonies, came to announce that supper
      had been waiting a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laramée, the advance guard of the baron&rsquo;s escort through the gorges of
      Ollioules, had the physiognomy of a real pandour; his complexion reddened
      by wine-drinking, his rough voice, his white and closely cut hair, his
      long gray moustache, and his continual swearing, were by no means to the
      taste of Dulceline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received the entrance of the majordomo into the sanctuary of the abbé
      with a sort of muttered remonstrance, which at last changed to sharp and
      loud complaint, when she saw that Laramée had the indiscretion to approach
      the veil which covered the mysterious cradle and try to lift it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Laramée,&rdquo; said the baron, &ldquo;Manjour, do you claim more
      privileges than your master, and insist upon seeing the wonders that
      Dulceline is hiding from our eyes? Come, come, take this lamp and light
      onr way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Mascarolus, Raimond V. said humorously: &ldquo;Since, according
      to your fine book, wood-lice will cure dropsy in nightingales, you ought
      to try your remedy on this old scoundrel, who surely is threatened with
      dropsy, for he is a veritable old bottle, swollen with wine, ready to
      burst; as for the rest, like the nightingale, he will sing at night,&mdash;and
      the devil knows what songs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur, and with a voice loud enough to wake the whole castle,
      and make the owls fly from the top of the old tower,&rdquo; added Dulceline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just as true as I drank two glasses of Sauvechrétien wine this
      morning, screech owls know the owls, Dulceline, my dear,&rdquo; said the
      majordomo with a jocose manner as he passed, lamp in hand, before the
      superintendent of the laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;do you hear the insolence of Master Laramée?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you shall be avenged, my dear, for I will make him drink a pint of
      water to your health. Come, come, go on, majordomo, the soup will get
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron, Reine, and the abbé left the pharmacy and descended the stairs,
      and crossed the long and dark gallery which united the two wings of
      Maison-Forte; they entered a large dining-room, brilliantly lighted by a
      good fire of beech, olive roots, and fir-apples, which shed through the
      whole room the odour of balsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immense chimney, with a large stone mantel, and andirons of massive
      iron, smoked a little, but by way of compensation, the windows latticed
      with lead, and the heavy doors of oak were not hermetically sealed, and
      the smoke found a way of escape through the numerous openings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The north wind, entering these cracks, made a shrill whistle, which was
      victoriously combatted by the merry crackling of the beech and olive logs
      which burned in the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls, simply plastered with lime, as well as the ceiling with its
      great projecting girders of black oak, had no other ornament than the
      skins of foxes and badgers and wolves, nailed at symmetrical distances by
      the careful hand of the majordomo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spaces between the skins hung fishing-lines, weapons of the chase,
      whips, and spurs; and as curiosities, a Moorish bridle with its two-edged
      bit and top-not of crimson silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an oak dresser, with a beautifully bowed front, stood an ancient and
      massive silver plate, whose richness contrasted singularly with the almost
      savage rusticity of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great bottles of white glass were filled with the generous wines of
      Provence and Languedoc; smaller flagons contained Spanish wines, easily
      and promptly brought from Barcelona by coasting ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few rustic valets, attired in cassocks of brown serge, served the table
      under the orders of the major-domo, the liveries with the colours of the
      baron never leaving the wardrobe except on feast-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oblong table placed near the fireside rested on a thick carpet of
      Spanish broom or esparto. The rest of the hall was paved with flags of
      sandstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the table was the armorial chair of Raimond V.; at his
      right, the cover for his daughter, at his left, the cover for the
      stranger,&mdash;a custom of touching hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below this place was the cover for the chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was delicately and abundantly served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around an enormous tureen of soup, made of the excellent sea eels of La
      Ciotat, and fragments of swordfish and sea dates, were fowls from the
      Pyrenees, which surrounded a perfectly roasted goose; on the other side, a
      saddle of lamb three months old, and the half of a kid one month old,
      justified by their appetising odour the culinary proverb: <i>Cabri d&rsquo;un
      mes, agneou de tres</i>,&mdash;kid of one month, lamb of three; shell-fish
      of all kinds, such as oysters and mussels, having above all the flavour of
      the rock, as the Provençals say, filled the spaces left between
      substantial viands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side-dishes strongly salted and spiced, such as shrimps, lobsters,
      artichokes, celery, and tender fennel, formed a formidable reserve which
      Raimond V. called to his aid, when his appetite showed signs of
      exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This profusion, which at first glance seemed so prodigal, was easily
      explained by the abundant resources of the country, the customary
      hospitality of the time, and the great number of persons a lord was
      expected to entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace being said by the worthy Abbé Mascarolus, the baron, his daughter,
      and the chaplain sat down to the table, and Laramée took his usual post
      behind the chair of his master.

      CHAPTER VIII. THE LOVER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The baron was scarcely seated, when he said:
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the devil is the matter with my head? Is Honorât not going to
      take supper with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He promised yesterday to do so,&rdquo; said Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you allow your betrothed to break his word? What o&rsquo;clock is it,
      Laramée?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, I have just posted the two sentinels on the rampart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say it is eight o&rsquo;clock, is it not, captain?&rdquo; merrily answered
      the baron to the majordomo, tending his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur, somewhat past eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that!&rdquo; replied the old gentleman, replacing his glass on the table,
      not without having emptied it. &ldquo;I hope nothing has happened to Honorat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, why not send a messenger on horseback to Berrol at once?&rdquo; said
      Reine, with keen interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my child; at any rate, we would feel assured: there is not
      much to fear, but at night the road through the morasses of Berrol is not
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom shall I send for the chevalier, monseigneur?&rdquo; said Laramée.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron was about to reply when the Chevalier de Berrol appeared,
      preceded by a valet who carried a lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in the devil do you come from, my son?&rdquo; said the Baron des Anbiez,
      extending his hand to Honorat, whom he called son since he was to marry
      his daughter. &ldquo;Did you meet the fairies in the quagmires of Berrol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my father, I was at the house of Seigneur de Saint-Yves, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
       Suddenly he approached the young girl, and said, &ldquo;Excuse me, I pray,
      Reine, for being late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She extended her hand to him with charming grace, and said, with a
      penetrating, almost serious tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy, very happy to see you, Honorât, for we were anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was in these few words, and in the look which accompanied them, such
      an expression of confidence, tenderness, and solicitude, that the
      chevalier started with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, sit down to the table, and as you have made your peace with
      Reine, tell us what detained you at the house of Seigneur de Saint-Yves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier handed his sword and cap to Laramée, and taking a seat by
      the side of the baron, replied: &ldquo;The recorder of the admiralty of Toulon,
      who is making a tour of the province, accompanied by a scribe and two
      guards of the governor, has come by order of the latter to visit the
      castle of Seigneur de Saint-Yves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manjour!&rdquo; cried the impetuous baron, &ldquo;I am sure that it concerns some
      insolent command! This marshal, murderer of our favourites, never means to
      give us another; and they say this recorder is the most arrant knave that
      ever announced a decree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, control yourself,&rdquo; said Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; Vitry does not deserve a generous anger. But it is hard,
      nevertheless, for the Provençal nobility to see such a man hold functions
      which, heretofore, have always been given to princes of the blood. But we
      live in strange times. Kings are asleep, cardinals reign, and bishops wear
      the cuirass and the belt. Do you think that is very canonical, abbé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good Mascarolus never liked to give a decided opinion, and he replied,
      humbly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, monseigneur, the canons of Jean VIII. and the text of St.
      Ambrose forbid prelates to bear arms; but on the other hand the literal
      interpretation of the Council of Worms authorises them to do so&mdash;with
      the Pope&rsquo;s approbation&mdash;when they possess domains independent of the
      Crown. Under Louis the Young, the Bishops of Paris went to battle. Hinemar
      and Hervien, Archbishops of Reims, led their troops under Charles the
      Bald, and under Charles the Simple; Tristan de Salazar, Archbishop of
      Reims, thoroughly armed, mounted on a good charger, a javelin in his hand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, abbé,&rdquo; interrupted the baron, &ldquo;by the grace of the cardinal,
      we shall grow accustomed to the sight of bishops equipped as soldiers,
      with a helmet for mitre, a military coat as a stole, a lance instead of a
      cross, and shedding blood in the place of sprinkling holy water,&mdash;it
      is altogether proper. Some wine, Laramée! And you, Honorât, finish your
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said the chevalier, &ldquo;the recorder Isnard, who they say has
      no pity for poor people, came, in the company of lawyers, to inform
      himself of the number of arms and quantity of ammunition that Seigneur de
      Saint-Yves kept in his castle,&mdash;in short, to draw up an account of
      it, according to the orders of the Marshal of Vitry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron had just emptied his glass gloriously. He still held it between
      his thumb and the index finger of his right hand. When he heard these
      words he remained motionless, looking at Honorât with a bewildered
      expression, and wiping mechanically, with the back of his left hand, his
      white moustache, which was soaked in wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier, without remarking the baron&rsquo;s astonishment, continued: &ldquo;As
      the Seigneur de Saint-Yves hesitated to comply with the demand of the
      recorder, who insisted almost with threats, saying that he acted by order
      of the governor of the province, in the name of the cardinal, I wished to
      interpose between them, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Saint-Yves did not nail these crows by the feet and hands to the
      door of his manor, to serve as a scarecrow to the others!&rdquo; cried the
      baron, purple with indignation, and setting his glass on the table so
      violently that it broke in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Reine, alarmed, as she saw the veins which furrowed the
      baron&rsquo;s bald forehead, swollen to bursting, &ldquo;Father, what does it matter
      to you? No doubt the Seigneur de Saint-Yves has acceded to the governor&rsquo;s
      demands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! obey such orders!&rdquo; shouted Raimond V., &ldquo;he! if he could be guilty of
      such cowardice, and dared appear again at the next assembly of the
      nobility of Aix, I would seize him by the collar, and chase him out of the
      hall with blows of my sword-belt. What! a recorder must enter our houses
      to take account of our arms, our powder, and our balls, as a bailiff takes
      account of a merchant&rsquo;s goods! Manjour! if it were the express and signed
      order of the King of France, our count, I would reply to such an order
      with good shots from musket and cannon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&mdash;&rdquo; said Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visit our castles!&rdquo; cried the baron, more and more exasperated. &ldquo;Ah, it
      is not enough to have placed at the head of the old nobility of Provence a
      Vitry!&mdash;a hired assassin,&mdash;but this cardinal&mdash;may hell
      confound him; pray for him, abbé, for he has devilish need of it&mdash;must
      impose upon us the most humiliating obligations! Visit our houses,
      forsooth! Ah, Vitry, you wish to know how we can fire our muskets and
      cannon, and, by God&rsquo;s death, come and lay siege to our castles and you
      shall know!&rdquo; Then turning with eagerness to Honorât, he asked: &ldquo;But what
      has Saint-Yves done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, at the time I left him, he was proposing to enter into an agreement
      to draw up, himself, the inventory demanded, and send it directly to the
      marshal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laramée,&rdquo; said the baron, rising abruptly from the table, &ldquo;have Mistraon
      saddled, mount five or six of my men and arm them well, and get ready
      yourself to follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Heaven, father, what are you going to do?&rdquo; cried Reine,
      taking one of the baron&rsquo;s hands in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prevent that good man, Saint-Yves, committing a cowardice which would
      dishonour the nobility of Provence. He is old and feeble, and he has not
      many persons around him; he will suffer himself to be intimidated.
      Laramée, my arms, and to horse, to horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This black night, over such bad roads&mdash;surely you will not dream of
      it,&rdquo; said Honorât, taking the other hand of the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear me, Laramée!&rdquo; shouted Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&mdash;&rdquo; said Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Manjour, my young master, I do what you ought to have done! At your
      age, I would have thrown the recorder and his guards out of the window.
      God&rsquo;s death! the blood of your fathers does not run in the veins of you
      young men! Laramée, my arms, and to horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honorât made no response to the baron&rsquo;s reproaches. He looked at Reine and
      shook his head to make her understand her father&rsquo;s injustice to his
      conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl understood the situation, and while Laramée was occupied in
      taking down his master&rsquo;s arms from one of the panoplies which ornamented
      the dining-hall, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laramée, have my nag saddled too; I will accompany monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil with such folly!&rdquo; said the baron, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly or not, I intend to accompany you, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, a hundred times no. You shall not go with me; such roads, and at
      such an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow you, father. You know I am wilful and obstinate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, as a goat, when you set your mind to it; but this time I hope
      you will yield to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down-stairs to prepare for my departure,&rdquo; said Reine. &ldquo;Come,
      Honorât.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil with such nonsense! She is capable of doing it as well as
      saying it Ah, there it is, I have been too good; I have been too indulgent
      to her; she abuses it!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman, stamping his foot with
      anger. Then taking a milder tone, he said: &ldquo;Let us see, Reine, my
      daughter, my dear daughter, be reasonable; just one dash of a gallop, and
      I am with Saint-Yves in time to drive away these wretches with blows of my
      whip, and I return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine made a step toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you may join me, Honorât; you are as unmoved as a worm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, father, do you forget that just now you stigmatised as cowardice his
      firm and prudent conduct in this affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, Honorât, my son, a coward? I would cut anybody in the face who would
      dare say it If I said that, I was wrong,&mdash;it was anger that carried
      me away. Honorât, my son&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. opened his arms to Honorât, who embraced him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe, me, sir, do not undertake this journey. My God! you will see
      these people only too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning, without doubt, they will be here,&mdash;not one house
      of the nobility will be exempt from this measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be here to-morrow!&rdquo; cried the baron, with an expression of joy
      difficult to portray. &ldquo;Ah, the recorder will be here to-morrow, he who has
      condemned poor devils to the galleys for the crime of smuggling. Ah, he
      will be here to-morrow! As God lives, it fills my heart with joy. Laramée,
      do not have the horses saddled, no, no, only to-morrow at daybreak prepare
      twenty good poles from hazel-trees, because I hope we will break a good
      many; then arrange a seesaw above the moat, and&mdash;but I will tell you
      to-night when I go to bed. Some wine, Laramée, some wine; give me my
      father&rsquo;s cup and Spanish wine, I must drink with solemnity to such a piece
      of news; some wine of Xeres, I tell you,&mdash;wine of Lamalgue to the
      devil! since the minions of the petty tyrant of Provence will be here
      to-morrow, and we will be able to lash them soundly with the straps that
      ought to be laid on Vitry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having said this, the baron sat down again in his armchair; each one took
      his place, to the great delight of the poor abbé, who, during this scene,
      had not dared to utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper, interrupted by this incident, was finished with a certain
      constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V., preoccupied with the reception that he was preparing for the
      agents, stopped every few moments to whisper something in Laramée&rsquo;s ear;
      it was easy to guess the subject of these secret conferences, by the air
      of profound satisfaction with which the old soldier received the
      instructions of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all soldiers, Laramée cherished an instinctive hatred of men of the
      law, and he did not dissimulate his joy at the thought of the reception
      awaiting the recorder and his scribe the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine and Honorât exchanged glances of distress; they knew the obstinate
      and irascible temper of the baron, his taste for rebellion, and aversion
      to Marshal of Vitry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl and her lover feared, not without reason, that the baron
      might become involved in some serious difficulty. Recent and terrible
      examples had proven that Richelieu desired to put an end to the
      independence of the lords, and absorb their feudal privileges in the power
      of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, they could not dream of preventing Raimond V., when once he
      determined upon any course of action, and his dependents were only too
      willing to second his dangerous projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Abbé Mascarolus ventured to say a few words on obedience,&mdash;that
      the lords owed it to themselves to set the example; but a severe glance
      from the eye of the baron cut short the chaplain&rsquo;s moralising, and he
      dared not defend the marshal as he had defended the warlike bishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine was not a little frightened at the baron&rsquo;s extravagant bursts of
      merriment and laughter, as he talked aside with Laramée.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was over, according to the ancient and invariable usage of
      hospitality, the baron took a lamp, and himself conducted Honorât de
      Berrol to the chamber he was to occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As upon previous occasions, the young man wished to spare the baron this
      ceremonial, arguing that his position as a betrothed lover rendered it
      unnecessary, but the old gentleman replied that not until after the
      festivities of Christmas, when the marriage rite was to be celebrated,
      could he be treated with less formality; until then, he must receive all
      the attention due a gentleman who slept under his roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine entered her chamber, followed by Stephanette. Her apartment was near
      that of her father, and listening she discovered to her great regret that
      Laramée remained with him longer than was his habit, and that the baron
      continued to make plans for the discomfiture of the recorder and officers.
      At a late hour of the night, she heard the majordomo order some of the
      baron&rsquo;s servants to carry invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distressed by these indications, she dismissed Stephanette, and returned
      to her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new object of astonishment, almost of terror, awaited her there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE PICTURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      After having shut the door which communicated with her father&rsquo;s rooms.
      Reine walked mechanically to the table standing in the embrasure of the
      window. What was her astonishment to see on this table a little picture
      encased in a frame of filigree, set with precious stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart beat violently; she recalled the crystal vase, and a secret
      presentiment told her that this picture had some mysterious connection
      with the adventure among the rocks of Ollioules.
    </p>
    <p>
      She approached it, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfection of this picture, painted on vellum, in imitation of ancient
      manuscripts, was incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It represented the scene in the gorges of Ollioules at the very moment
      when the baron, embracing his daughter, had extended his hand to the young
      stranger; at a distance on the rock, Pog and Trimalcyon, the two foreign
      personages of whom we have spoken, appeared to command the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Reine had seen these two men but a moment, the likeness in the
      picture was so striking that she recognised them. She shuddered
      involuntarily at the sinister expression of Fog&rsquo;s face, easily known by
      his long red beard and the bitter smile which contracted his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The features of the baron, as well as those of Reine, were rendered with
      surprising fidelity and perfect art, although the faces were scarcely
      larger than the nail of the little finger. They were drawn with a delicacy
      which was marvellous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the inimitable skill displayed in this ravishing picture,
      an odd, extravagant thing destroyed its harmony and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pose, person, and costume of Erebus&mdash;the strange young man&mdash;were
      perfectly portrayed; but his head disappeared beneath a small cloud, in
      the centre of which was represented the enamelled dove already portrayed
      on the crystal vase.
    </p>
    <p>
      This omission was strange, and perhaps cleverly calculated, inasmuch as
      Reine, in spite of her fear and astonishment, could not help calling
      memory to her aid in order to complete the portrait of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw it in her own mind, instead of on the vellum which she held in her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, besides, on the part of the stranger, a sort of delicacy in
      thus effacing his own features under a symbol which represented to his
      mind the most precious memory of that day; or he may have adopted this
      means to quiet the scruples of the young girl, should she decide to keep
      the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to comprehend the struggle between the desire to keep the picture
      and the resolve to destroy it, which rose in the young girl&rsquo;s mind, we
      must say a few words about Reine&rsquo;s love for Honorât de Berrol, and her own
      sentiments after the adventure in the gorges of Ollioules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât de Berrol was an orphan and distant relative of Raimond V. He had
      considerable fortune, his estates lying near those of the baron, and
      community of interest as well as other ties bound the chevalier and the
      old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two or three years Honorât came almost every day to Maison-Forte. The
      chevalier was the impersonation of rectitude, sincerity, and honour. His
      education, without being extraordinary, was superior to that of most young
      men of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was actively occupied in the management of his estates; his order and
      his economy were remarkable, although, when an opportunity presented
      itself, he knew how to be generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was not unusual, but he had plenty of good sense and reason, and
      his character, naturally charming, could be firm and decided when
      circumstances demanded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His predominating characteristic was a love of justice. Little given to
      enthusiasm or exaggeration, and supremely happy in his position, he looked
      forward to his marriage with the baron&rsquo;s daughter with a pure and serene
      joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no romantic aspect to this love. Before allowing himself to fall
      in love with Reine, Honorât had frankly expressed his intentions to the
      baron, and asked him to learn his daughter&rsquo;s feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good gentleman, who never temporised or resorted to half-measures,
      replied to Honorât that the alliance would be agreeable to him, and at
      once told Reine of the chevalier&rsquo;s proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine was then sixteen years old; she was pleased with the appearance and
      bearing of the Chevalier de Berrol, for the manners of most of the country
      gentlemen who visited Maison-Forte suffered much by comparison with those
      of her amiable relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine accepted the baron&rsquo;s plans, and the baron wrote at length to his
      brothers, the commander and Father Elzear, without whose advice he did
      nothing, concerning the happy betrothal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their response was favourable to Honorât, and the marriage was fixed for
      the Christmas celebration which would follow the young girl&rsquo;s eighteenth
      birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed two years in the midst of sweet hopes and a pure, calm love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât, serious and gentle, began at once his part as mentor, and by
      degrees acquired a great ascendancy over the mind of Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. loved his daughter so foolishly and idolatrously, that the
      happy influence of Honorât saved her from her father&rsquo;s weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had lost her mother when she was in the cradle, and had been
      reared under the eyes of the baron by Stephanette&rsquo;s mother, an excellent
      woman, and, although happily endowed with good instincts, had been
      permitted to indulge her caprice at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lively imagination exaggerated sympathy and antipathy, and she often
      received the wise and reasonable suggestions of Honorât with mischievous
      irony and even resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legend and romance were the mental food she craved, and often in thought
      she pictured herself as the heroine of some strange adventure. Honorât
      would dissipate these fantastic visions by a breath, and not infrequently
      reproached Reine, with as much good-humour as gaiety, for these vagabond
      imaginations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these little differences were soon forgotten. Reine would confess her
      wrong-doing with adorable frankness, and the beautiful affection of the
      two lovers seemed only to increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously, Reine began to feel the influence of Honorât more and more
      in her daily life, and instead of indulging herself in vague reveries and
      foolish imaginations, occupied her mind with graver thoughts. She
      recognised the nothingness of her former dreams, and every step of this
      wise and happy way served to establish her love for Chevalier de Berrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind and character had undergone such a complete transformation under
      the influence of Honorât, that her father, sometimes, when he had gone
      beyond the limits of temperance, would say in jest that Reine was becoming
      insupportably serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentiment of Reine for Honorât was by no means a passionate love,
      nourished by difficulties and uncertainties, but a calm, sincere, and
      reasonable affection, in which the young girl recognised, with a sort of
      tender veneration, the superior reason of her betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the sentiments of Mlle, des Anbiez when the fatal meeting in the
      rocks of Ollioules took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time that she saw Erebus, placed her under the influence of a
      profound sentiment of gratitude; he had just saved the baron&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine, perhaps, might never have observed the surprising beauty of the
      stranger, but for the startling circumstances by which he was presented to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that he had just delivered her father from a frightful danger was
      the most powerful fascination that Erebus could offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the charm was broken when, after the few words uttered by his
      companions, his countenance and manner changed, and he had the audacity to
      press his lips to hers. The features of the stranger, that a moment before
      possessed a beauty so pure, and an amiability so lovely, seemed suddenly
      to disappear under the mask of an insolent libertine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that day, Erebus appeared to her always under these two different
      physiognomies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she tried to banish from her memory all thought of an audacious
      stranger, who had insolently robbed her of what she would have given to
      her father&rsquo;s saviour with reluctance. Again, she would dream, with a deep
      sentiment of gratitude, that her father owed his life to this same
      stranger who at first seemed so courageous and so timid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily for Reine&rsquo;s repose of mind, Erebus united and justified, so to
      speak, these two distinct natures, and in her thought she gave him
      sometimes her admiration, and sometimes her contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she wavered between these two sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the natural exaggeration of her character, rather suppressed than
      destroyed, was excited by this singular adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unknown one seemed to her the genius of good and the genius of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily, her excitable mind tried to penetrate the secret of this
      double power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine herself was made aware of her morbid mental condition only by the
      tender reproaches of Honorât, who accused her of distraction. For the
      first time, then, Reine realised with horror the empire that the unknown
      person had gained over her mind; she resolved to escape from it, but the
      resistance with which she endeavoured to drive Erebus from her mind, only
      made her think of him the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her vexation she shed bitter tears, and sought refuge and diversion in
      the calm and wise conversation of Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could make her forget the past. Notwithstanding his goodness and
      kindness, her betrothed seemed to weary her, and even wound her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared not open her heart to him. The baron, too, was the best of
      fathers, yet absolutely incapable of comprehending the unaccountable
      anguish of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concentrated by silence, and overexcited by solitude, a sentiment mingled
      with curiosity, admiration, and almost hatred, began to take deep root in
      the heart of Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times she shuddered to see that the gravity of Honorât oppressed her.
      In her thought she reproached him for having nothing in his career that
      was adventurous or romantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      She compared his peaceful and uniform life with the mystery which
      surrounded the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, ashamed of such thoughts, she sought to fix her hopes upon her
      approaching union with Honorât,&mdash;a union so sacred that, in the
      fulfilment of its duties, every foolish dream and imagination would be
      effaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of Reine&rsquo;s heart when, by an inexplicable mystery, she
      found in the same day two objects, the sight of which redoubled her
      anguish and excited every power of her imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stranger, or one of his agents, was then near her, though invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not suspect the servants within the walls of Maison-Forte of
      being in collusion with the stranger. All of them were old servants, grown
      gray in the service of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reared, so to speak, by them, she was too well acquainted with their life
      and morality to believe them capable of underhand manoeuvres. The fact
      that the picture was placed on her praying-stool in her chamber,
      disquieted her above all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on the point of going to her father and telling him all, but an
      instinctive love of the marvellous restrained her; she feared to break the
      charm. Her romantic character found a sort of pleasure, mingled with fear,
      in this mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inaccessible to superstition, of a firm and decided mind, and recognising
      the fact that, after all, there was nothing really dangerous in allowing
      this strange adventure to take its course, Reine reassured herself, after
      searching her chamber and the connecting one very carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took up the picture again, looked at it for some time, then, after
      dreaming awhile, she threw it into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed the destruction of this little masterpiece with a melancholy
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a strange chance the vellum, detached from the frame, caught first on
      both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the figure of Erebus burned the last and was outlined a moment on the
      burning embers,&mdash;then a light flame leaped upon it, and all
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine remained a long time gazing in the fireplace, as though she still
      saw there the picture which had been consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock of Maison-Forte struck two in the morning; the young girl
      returned to her senses, went to bed, and, for a long time, tried to fall
      asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE RECORDER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the occurrence of the events we have just related, a group
      of several persons, some on foot, and others on horseback, skirted the
      edge of the sea, and seemed to direct their course toward the Gulf of La
      Ciotat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important personage of this little caravan was a man of
      considerable corpulence, with a solemn and formal countenance, wearing a
      travelling-cloak over his habit of black velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a chain of silver around his neck, and rode a little horse with an
      ambling gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      These personages were no other than Master Isnard, recorder of the
      admiralty of Toulon, and his clerk or scribe, who, mounted on an old white
      mule, carried behind enormous bags filled with bundles of papers, and two
      large registers in their boxes of black shagreen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk was a little middle-aged man, with a pointed nose, a pointed
      chin, high cheek-bones, and sharp eyes. This nose, this chin, and these
      cheek-bones, and these eyes were very red, thanks to the very keen wind
      from the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      A valet, mounted on another mule, laden with wallets, and two halberdiers,
      dressed in green and orange-coloured cassocks trimmed with white lace,
      accompanied the recorder and his clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that the two officers of justice did not enjoy an unmarred
      serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard, especially, betrayed his bad humour, from time to time, by
      imprecations upon the cold, the weather, the roads, and particularly upon
      his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk responded to these complaints with a humble and pitiful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my oath!&rdquo; cried the recorder, &ldquo;here I am only two days on my circuit,
      and it is far from promising anything agreeable. Hm! the nobility takes
      this census of arms ordered by the Marshal of Vitry very ill; they receive
      us in their castles like Turks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are happy to be received at all, Master Isnard,&rdquo; said the clerk;
      &ldquo;the lord of Signerol shut his door in our faces, and we were obliged to
      draw up our report by the light of the moon. The lord of Saint-Yves
      received us reluctantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all these resistances, open or mute, to the orders of his Eminence,
      the cardinal, will be duly recorded, clerk, and bad intentions will be
      punished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately, the reception given by the Baron des Anbiez will indemnify
      us for these tribulations, Master Isnard. They say the old lord is the
      best of men. His jovial nature is as well known throughout the country as
      the austerity of his brother, the commander of the black galley, or the
      charity of Father Elzear of the Order of Mercy, his other brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! Raimond V. does well to be hospitable,&rdquo; growled the recorder; &ldquo;he is
      one of those old strife-stirrers, always ready to draw his sword against
      any established power; but patience, clerk, good courage, the reign of men
      of peace and justice has come, thank God! All these arrogant disputants,
      with long rapiers and spurs, will keep as quiet in their strong castles as
      wolves in their dens, or, on my oath, we will rase their houses to the
      ground and sow salt on them. However,&rdquo; added Master Isnard, as if he
      wanted to give himself artificial courage, &ldquo;we are always sure of the
      support of the cardinal; just let them touch a hair of our heads,&mdash;why,
      you see, clerk, that it would be the same as pulling a hair out of the
      beard of his Eminence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would be dreadfully injurious to the said Eminence, Master Isnard,
      as they say he has a regular cat&rsquo;s beard,&mdash;thin and sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an ass!&rdquo; said the recorder, shrugging his shoulders, and giving
      his horse a thrust of the spur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk lowered his head, said no more, and blew through his fingers by
      way of keeping in countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little caravan followed the road for some time along the beach, the
      sea on the right, and interminable rocks on the left, when they were
      joined by a traveller modestly seated on a donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tawny complexion of this man, with his overcoat of leather, his red
      cap, from which escaped a forest of black hair, curled and standing on
      end, and a little portable forge, fastened to one side of the pack-saddle
      on the back of his donkey, proved him to be one of those strolling
      Bohemians who go from farm to village, offering their services to
      housekeepers as repairers of household utensils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the cold, the legs and feet of this man were naked. His
      delicate and nervous limbs, and his expressive face, scarcely shaded by a
      black and distinctly marked beard, presented the type peculiar to the men
      of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      His donkey was quiet and tractable, and had neither bit nor bridle,&mdash;he
      guided it by means of a stick which he held to the animal&rsquo;s left eye, if
      he wished to go to the right, and to the right eye if he wished him to go
      to the left. As he approached the recorder and his attendants, the
      Bohemian took the donkey by one of his long, pendent ears, and stopped him
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me, sir,&rdquo; said the Bohemian to the recorder, respectfully,
      &ldquo;if I am still far from La Ciotat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recorder, thinking, doubtless, the man unworthy of a reply from him,
      made a disdainful gesture, and said to his scribe:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer him, clerk,&rdquo; and rode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mouth is the mistress, the ear is the slave,&rdquo; said the Bohemian,
      bowing himself humbly before the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk inflated his thin cheeks, assumed a haughty air, seated himself
      on his mule with triumphant dignity, and said to the valet who followed
      him, as he pointed to the Bohemian:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lackey, reply to him,&rdquo; and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little John, more compassionate, told the wanderer that he could follow
      the caravan, as it was on its way to a place quite near the town of La
      Ciotat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two halberdiers were a short distance in the rear, and, joining the
      principal group, all continued to move forward on the beach. The sun soon
      made its influence felt; although it was in the month of December, its
      rays became so warm that Master Isnard felt the need of relieving himself
      of his cloak. He tossed it to his clerk, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure, clerk, that you recognise the route to Maison-Forte, the
      castle of Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez? For we are to stop first at his
      dwelling. It is from that point that I will begin the census of arms in
      this diocese. Eh, eh, clerk, the morning air and salt odour of the beach
      gives me an appetite! They say the baron has the good cheer of an abbé,
      and the hospitality of the good King René. So much the better, on my oath!
      so much the better, clerk. Instead of putting up for fifteen days at some
      paltry hostelry of La Ciotat, eh, eh! I will make my winter quarters at
      Maison-Forte of Raimond V., and you will follow me, clerk,&rdquo; said the
      recorder, giving himself airs. &ldquo;Instead of your bacon with garlic and
      beans, and your codfish seasoned with oil for high days, you will only
      have to choose between fowl, venison, and the best fish of the gulf. Eh,
      eh! for a starved wretch like you, it is a rare windfall, so, clerk, you
      can get a big mouthful&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor scribe made no reply to these coarse pleasantries, by which he
      felt humiliated, and only said to the recorder: &ldquo;I recognise the road
      easily, Master Isnard, because there is a post bearing the escutcheon of
      Raimond V., and a milestone which marks the land belonging to the house of
      Baux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lands of Baux!&rdquo; cried the recorder, with indignation. &ldquo;Another one of
      the abuses that his Eminence will destroy, on my oath! It is enough to
      make one insane to try to find his way out of-this labyrinth of feudal
      privileges!&rdquo; Then, passing from grave to gay, the recorder added, with a
      loud laugh, &ldquo;Eh, eh! it would be as difficult a task as for you to
      distinguish the wine of Xeres from the wine of Malaga, accustomed as you
      are to drink the second pressing of the grape like a fish, and then taste
      a glass of Sauve-chrétien, to put a good taste in your mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And happy when this grape-water does not fail us, Master Isnard,&rdquo; said
      the poor clerk, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, eh! then the river never fails, and asses can drink at their ease,&rdquo;
       replied the recorder, insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      His unhappy victim could only hang his head in silence, while the
      recorder, proud of his triumph, put his hand above his eyes, hoping to
      discover the roof of Maison-Forte des Anbiez, as his appetite was growing
      clamorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, who rode behind the two talkers, had heard their
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although his features were common, they showed much penetration and
      intelligence. His little, piercing, changing black eyes constantly moved
      from the recorder to the clerk with an expression by turns ironical and
      compassionate. When Master Isnard had finished conversation by his coarse
      witticism on asses, he contracted his eyebrows into a severe frown, and
      seemed about to speak, but whether he feared the recorder, or was afraid
      of saying too much, he remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, clerk,&rdquo; cried the recorder, stopping short before a post,
      painted with a coat of arms, which marked a division of the road, &ldquo;is not
      this the route to Des Anbiez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Master Isnard, but we must leave the shore. This is the road to
      Maison-Forte; it is about two hundred steps from here; this rock hides it
      from you,&rdquo; answered the clerk, as he pointed to a sort of little
      promontory which thrust itself into the sea, and thus interfered with a
      view of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, clerk, go on before,&rdquo; said the recorder, checking his own horse,
      and giving a blow of his switch to the scribe&rsquo;s mule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk rode on in advance, and the little band ventured into a
      precipitous road which wound its way across the rocks on the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s travel, the road became level, and wooded
      hills, vines, olive-trees, and sown fields succeeded the rocks. Master Isnard
      at last saw, to his great joy, the imposing pile of Maison-Forte. It stood
      out at the end of an immense avenue, planted with six rows of beeches and
      sycamores, which conducted to the vast court of which we have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, eh!&rdquo; said the recorder, expanding his nostrils, &ldquo;it is about midday;
      it ought to be the dinner-hour of Raimond V., for these country lords
      follow the old Provençal custom: they take four meals; every four hours,&mdash;breakfast
      at eight o&rsquo;clock, dine in the middle of the day, lunch at four o&rsquo;clock,
      and sup at eight.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed, then they must eat nearly all day long,&rdquo; said
      the clerk, with a sigh of envy, &ldquo;for they often sit three or four hours at
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, eh! you are licking your lean lips already, clerk; but do you not see
      a thick smoke on the side of the kitchens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Isnard, I do not know where the kitchens are,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;I
      have never been inside Maison-Forte, but I do see a thick smoke above the
      tower which looks toward the west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do not detect the odour of fish-soup, or roast? On my oath, in
      the house of Raimond V. it ought to be Christmas every day. Come, can&rsquo;t
      you scent something, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk held his nose in the air like a dog on the scent, and replied,
      with a shake of the head: &ldquo;Master, I scent nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the recorder had arrived a few steps from the court of Maison-Forte,
      he was astonished to see no one outside of this large habitation, at an
      hour when domestic duties always require so much commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, the court formed a sort of parallelogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the farther end of this parallelogram rose the main dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each side could be seen its wings at right angles, and the buildings
      occupied by persons in the employ of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first plane rose a high wall, pierced with loopholes for cannon, in
      the middle of which opened a massive door. In front of this wall stretched
      a wide and deep ditch, filled with water, which was crossed by means of a
      movable bridge, built directly in front of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder and his retinue arrived at the entrance of the bridge, where
      they found Master Laramée.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majordomo, solemnly clothed in black, bore in his hand a white rod, a
      distinctive mark of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder descended from his horse with an important air, and, turning
      to Laramée, said: &ldquo;In the name of the king, and his Eminence, the
      cardinal, I, Master Isnard, recorder, have come to take census and
      catalogue of the arms and ammunition of war, retained here in this castle
      of Maison-Forte, belonging to Sir Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to his train, which the Bohemian had joined, he said: &ldquo;All of
      you follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laramée made a profound bow, and with a sly expression of face said to the
      recorder, as he indicated the road: &ldquo;If you will follow me, Master
      Recorder, I will show you our magazine of arms and artillery.&rdquo; Encouraged
      by this reception, Master Isnard and his retinue crossed the bridge,
      leaving their horses outside, tied to the parapet, according to the
      instruction of the majordomo.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the court planted with trees, the recorder said to
      Laramée: &ldquo;Is your master at home? We are very hungry and very thirsty,
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The majordomo looked up at the recorder, lifted his cap, and replied: &ldquo;You
      condescend, sir; you call me friend; you honour me too much, Master
      Recorder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on! I am as kind as a prince. If the baron is not at table,
      conduct me first to him; if he is at table, conduct me to him all the
      sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur has just been served, Master Recorder. I am going to open the
      door of honour for you, as is proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, Laramée disappeared through a narrow passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder, his clerk, his valet, the Bohemian, and the two halberdiers
      remained in the court, staring at the great portal of the castle,
      expecting every moment to see its massive doors open for their reception.
      They did not see that two men had removed the bridge, beyond the ditch, on
      the side of the fields, thus cutting off all retreat from the men of the
      law.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. TAKING THE CENSUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the side of the court, as on the side of the sea, three windows of the
      gallery, which extended the full length of the edifice, opened upon a
      balcony which was over the principal door of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder began to realise that it required much ceremony to introduce
      him to the baron, when suddenly the windows were opened, and ten or twelve
      gentlemen, in handsome hunting-suits, booted and spurred, holding a glass
      in one hand and a napkin in the other, rushed out on the balcony, shouting
      and laughing at the top of their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their head was Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to see by the flushed cheeks of these joyous companions that
      they had just arisen from the table, and had emptied more than one bottle
      of Spanish wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convivial friends of Raimond V. belonged to the nobility of the
      neighbourhood, and were all known for their hatred of Marshal of Vitry,
      and open or secret opposition to Cardinal Richelieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât de Berrol and Reine, utterly powerless to dissuade the baron from
      his dangerous projects, had retired into one of the apartments in the
      tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder began to think he was mistaken in counting on a favourable
      reception from the baron; he even feared that he might be made the victim
      of some infernal trick, as he saw the clamorous gaiety of the guests of
      Maison-Forte, especially when he recognised among the number the old lord
      of Signerol, who had rudely refused him entrance into his castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he tried to put a good face on the matter, and followed by his
      clerk, who was trembling in every limb, he advanced to the balcony with
      his two halberdiers at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing himself to Raimond V., who was leaning over the balcony railing
      and looking contemptuously on the company below, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of the king and his Eminence, the cardinal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cardinal to the devil! Let his infernal Eminence return to the place
      he came from!&rdquo; shouted several gentlemen, interrupting the recorder&rsquo;s
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelzebub, at this moment, is making a red brass hat for his Eminence,&rdquo;
       said the lord of Signerol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girdles of his Eminence ought to be good rope for hanging!&rdquo; said
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the recorder have his say, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the baron, turning to his
      guests, &ldquo;let him speak, my friends,&mdash;it is not by a single note that
      you recognise the bird of the night. Come on, Manjour! speak, recorder,
      speak, read out your scrawl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, completely demoralised, and doubtless meditating a retreat,
      turned his head away from the door, and discovered with dismay that the
      bridge had been withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Isnard,&rdquo; whispered he, with broken voice, &ldquo;we are caught in a
      mouse-trap; they have carried away the bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the self-possession he affected, the recorder looked over
      his shoulder, and said, in a low voice: &ldquo;Clerk, order the halberdiers to
      approach without attracting attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk obeyed; the little band concentrated in the middle of the court,
      with the exception of the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing at the foot of the balcony, he seemed to contemplate with
      curiosity the gentlemen gathered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard, anxious to accomplish his task, and seeing that he had been
      mistaken in presuming upon the hospitality of Raimond V., read, not
      without hesitation, the judicial summary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of his Majesty, our sire, King of France and of Navarre, and
      Count of Provence, and of his Eminence, the cardinal, I, Thomas Isnard,
      recorder of the admiralty of Toulon, sent by the king&rsquo;s attorney to the
      seat of the said admiralty, make here in this Maison-Forte the census and
      catalogue of the arms and ammunitions of war therein enclosed, in order to
      draw up a statement, on which statement his Excellence, the Marshal of
      Vitry, Governor of Provence, will decide to the end that we may be advised
      as to what quantity of arms and ammunition ought to be left in the said
      Maison-Forte; accordingly, I, Thomas Isnard, recorder of the admiralty of
      Toulon, here present myself in person to the said Raimond V., Baron des
      Anbiez, praying him of necessity to obey the orders signified. Made at
      Maison-Forte des Anbiez, dependent of the diocese of Marseilles, and the
      jurisdiction of Aix, December 17,1632.&rdquo; The old baron and his friends
      listened to the recorder with perfect calmness, exchanging frequent
      glances of contempt. When Master Isnard had concluded, Raimond V. leaned
      over the railing of the balcony and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy recorder, worthy deputy of the worthy Marshal of Vitry, and of the
      worthy Cardinal Richelieu,&mdash;God save the king, our count, from his
      Eminence,&mdash;we, Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, and master of this poor
      mansion, we authorise you to complete your mission. You see that door
      there on the left, on which is nailed the sign-board, &lsquo;Arms and
      Artillery,&rsquo;&mdash;open it, and perform the duties of your office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words the old gentleman and his guests sat with their
      elbows on the balcony railing, as if they had prepared themselves for the
      enjoyment of an interesting and unusual spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard had followed with his eyes the gesture of the baron, which
      indicated to him the mysterious magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a door of medium size, on which could easily be read the newly
      painted words, &ldquo;Arms and Artillery.&rdquo; This door was situated in the middle
      of the left wing, which was largely made up of rooms for the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being able to account for his repugnance, the recorder looked at
      the door of the magazine with suspicion, and said to Raimond V., with an
      air almost arrogant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send some one of your people to open that door!&rdquo; The old gentleman&rsquo;s face
      became purple with anger; he was on the point of flying into a passion,
      but restrained himself and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my people, Master Recorder? Alas, I do not have them any longer.
      The good old man who received you is my only servant; the taxes imposed by
      your worthy cardinal, and the tribute he exacts from us, have reduced the
      Provençal nobility to beggary, as you see! You are accompanied by two
      companions with halberds, and a fellow with a serge mantle,&rdquo;&mdash;here
      the clerk made a respectful bow,&mdash;&ldquo;your own people are more than
      enough to put your orders in execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, seeing the Bohemian at the foot of the balcony, Raimond called to
      him: &ldquo;Eh, you man there with the red cap, who in the devil are you? What
      are you doing there? Do you belong to this band?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wanderer approached the balcony, and said: &ldquo;Monseigneur, I am a poor
      travelling artisan, who lives by his work. I come from Bany. I was on my
      way to La Ciotat, and I entered to see if I could get work at the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manjour!&rdquo; exclaimed the baron, &ldquo;you are my guest; do not stay in the
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this remarkable invitation, the men of the law looked frightened, and
      at the same instant the Bohemian, with a wonderful agility, climbed up one
      of the granite pillars which supported the balcony, as quick as a wildcat,
      and seated himself at the feet of the baron, outside of the balustrade, on
      a little slab projecting from the balcony floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ascension of the Bohemian was so rapid, and done so cleverly, that it
      excited the admiration of the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron, laughingly seizing one of his long black locks of hair, said to
      him: &ldquo;You climb too well to travel in the main road; it is my opinion,
      fellow, that windows are your doors, and roofs serve you as a place to
      promenade. Come in the house, boy; Laramée will give you something to
      drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a light bound the Bohemian jumped over the railing of the balcony,
      and entered the gallery, which served as dining-room on important
      occasions, where he found the remains of the abundant dinner of which the
      baron&rsquo;s guests had just partaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder remained in the court with his escort, not knowing upon what
      course to resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the unlucky door with a vague disquietude, while the old
      gentleman and his friends betrayed some impatience as they waited for the
      end of this scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Master Isnard, wishing to get out of an embarrassing position,
      turned to the baron and said, with a solemn air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call to witness the people who accompany me if anything unbecoming
      happens to me, and you will answer, sir, for any dangerous and secret
      ambuscade which could hurt the dignity of the law or of justice, or our
      honourable person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Manjour! what are you crowing about? Nobody here wishes to interfere
      with your office; my arms and my artillery are there: enter, examine, and
      count; the key is in the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, go in, the key is in the door,&rdquo; repeated the chorus of guests,
      with a sneer which seemed a sinister omen to the recorder. Exasperated
      beyond measure, but keeping himself at a respectful distance from the
      door, the recorder said to his scribe:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clerk, go and open this door; let us make an end of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Master Isnard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey, clerk, obey,&rdquo; said the recorder, still drawing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor scribe showed the register which he held in one hand, and the pen
      that he held in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hands are not free. I must be ready to draw up an official report. If
      some sorcery bursts out of that door, ought I not, on the very instant,
      enter it upon my verbal process?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These reasons appeared to make some impression on the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little John, open that door,&rdquo; said he to the lackey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, master, I dare not,&rdquo; replied Little John, getting behind the
      recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me, you wretch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, but I dare not; there is some sorcery there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, on my oath, if you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the salvation of my soul depended on it, sir, I would not open it,&rdquo;
       said Little John, in a resolute tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said the recorder, overcome with vexation, as he addressed
      the halberdiers, &ldquo;it will be said, my brave fellows, that you alone acted
      as men in this stupid affair! Open that door, and put an end to this
      ridiculous scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two guards retreated a step, and one of them said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Master Isnard, we are here to give you assistance as far as we
      are able, if any one rebels against your orders, but no one forbids you to
      enter. The key is in the door; enter alone, if you wish to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, an old pandour like you afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The halberdier shook his head, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Master Isnard, halberds and swords are worth nothing here; what
      we need is a priest with his stole, and a holy water sprinkler in his
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Michael is right, Master Isnard,&rdquo; said the other guard; &ldquo;it is my opinion
      that we will have to do what was done to exorcise the dolphins that
      infested the coast last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that dog of a Bohemian had not run away like a coward,&rdquo; said the
      recorder, stamping his foot with rage, &ldquo;he might have opened the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, happening to turn his head, the recorder discovered several men and
      women standing at the windows of Maison-Forte; they were partially hidden
      by the basement, but were looking curiously into the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      More from self-esteem than courage, Master Isnard, seeing that he was
      observed by so many persons, walked deliberately to the door, and put his
      hand on the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment his heart failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard in the magazine a rumbling noise and extraordinary excitement,
      which he had not detected before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds were harsh, with nothing human in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A magic charm seemed to fasten the recorder&rsquo;s hand to the key in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, recorder, my boy, go on! there you are! go on!&rdquo; cried one of the
      guests, clapping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wager he is as warm as if it were the month of August, although the
      wind is blowing from the north,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him time to invoke his patron and make a vow,&rdquo; said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His patron is St. Coward,&rdquo; said the lord of Signerol; &ldquo;no doubt he is
      making a vow never to brave another danger if he delivers him from this
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pushed to extremity by these jeers, and reflecting that, after all,
      Raimond V. was not so cruel as to force him into real danger, the recorder
      opened the door, and suddenly jumped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he was roughly overthrown by the onset of two Camargnan
      bulls, that rushed from the stable, head downward, and uttering a peculiar
      and stifled bellowing, for they were muzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two animals were not of very large size, but were full of vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was tawny, streaked with dark brown; the other was black as jet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first use they made of their liberty was to bound over the court, paw
      the earth with their fore feet, and try to divest themselves of their
      muzzles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the two bulls was greeted with hurrahs and bravos by the
      guests of the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, well, recorder, your inventory?&rdquo; cried Raimond V., holding his sides,
      and giving full vent to his hilarity. &ldquo;Come, clerk, enter upon your
      official report my bulls, Nicolin and Saturnin. Ah! you demand the arms
      that I possess,&mdash;there they are. It is with the horns of these
      fellows from Camargne that I defend myself. Eh, Man-jour! I see by your
      fear that you recognise them as arms, serious and offensive. Come,
      recorder, label Nicolin, and draw up Saturnin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s death!&rdquo; cried the lord of Signerol, &ldquo;these bulls look as if they
      would like to make an inventory of the clerk&rsquo;s and recorder&rsquo;s breeches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Our Lady, in spite of his corpulence, the recorder made a leap then
      that would do honour to a toreador!&rdquo; &ldquo;And the clerk,&mdash;how he winds
      around the trees! He is equal to a frightened weasel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas! Christmas! Nicolin has a piece of his cloak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that these different exclamations described the
      phases of the improvised race with which Raimond V. entertained his
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bulls were in hot pursuit of the recorder and his clerk, whom they
      wished first to attack. The halberdiers and Little John had prudently
      availed themselves of the protection of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the trees planted in the court, the recorder and his clerk were
      able for some time to escape the attacks of the bulls by running from tree
      to tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after awhile their strength was exhausted. Fear paralysed their
      energies, and they were about to be trampled under foot by these ferocious
      animals. Be it said to the praise of Raimond V. that, notwithstanding the
      brutality of his savage pleasantry, he would have been distressed beyond
      measure if a tragedy had ended this adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily one of the halberdiers screamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Isnard,&mdash;climb a tree,&mdash;quick, quick, before the bull
      gets back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The corpulent recorder followed the halberdier&rsquo;s counsel, and throwing
      himself upon the trunk of a sycamore, he held on with knees, feet, and
      hands, making unheard-of efforts in his clumsy ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron and his guests, seeing that the man was no longer in real
      danger, again began their jests and laughter. The clerk, more nimble than
      the recorder, was now safely seated in the top of a sycamore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Bruin has come at last! Take care, beware!&rdquo; cried Raimond,
      laughing till the tears came in his eyes at the efforts of the recorder,
      who was trying to straddle one of the largest branches of the tree he had
      climbed with so much difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the recorder looks like an old bear climbing his pole,&rdquo; said another,
      &ldquo;the clerk looks like an old, shivering monkey,&mdash;see his jaws
      chatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, clerk, get to your task; where is your pen and your ink, and
      your register? You are safe, now,&mdash;scribble your scrawl,&rdquo; cried the
      old lord of Signerol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attention, attention, the tournament has begun!&rdquo; cried one of the guests.
      &ldquo;It is Nicolin against a halberdier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Largess, largess for Nicolin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the two men of the law safe from their horns, the bulls had turned
      upon the halberdiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one of the halberdiers, throwing himself against the wall, pricked the
      animal so sharply in the nose and the shoulder, that the bull dared not
      make another attack, and bounded off into the middle of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the courage of the halberdier, the baron cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear, my brave fellow, you shall have ten francs to drink his
      health, and I will furnish the wine gratis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then addressing the invisible Larmaée, the old gentleman ordered: &ldquo;Tell
      the shepherd to send his dogs, and drive these bulls back into the stable.
      The dance of the recorder and the clerk has lasted long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron had hardly finished speaking, when three shepherd dogs of large
      size came out of a half-open door and ran straight after the bulls. After
      a few flourishes, the animals ended the farce by galloping into the
      stable, the magazine of arms and artillery of Maison-Forte, as the
      treacherous sign-board had announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder and his clerk, seeing themselves delivered from danger, still
      did not dare descend from their impregnable position. In vain Laramée,
      bearing two glasses of wine on a silver plate, came offering the
      stirrup-cup from the baron, and telling them, what was true, that the
      bridge had been replaced, and their horses and mules were waiting for them
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go from here only that my clerk may draw up an official statement of
      the grievous outrage by which the baron, your master, has rendered himself
      amenable,&rdquo; cried the recorder, almost breathless, wiping the sweat from
      his brow, which literally ran with water, in spite of the cold weather.
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are reserving some other bad treatment for us, but the
      governor, and if necessary the cardinal himself, will avenge me, and on my
      oath, there shall not remain one stone on another of this accursed house&mdash;may
      Satan confound it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V., holding in his hand a long hunting-whip, descended into the
      court, gave the ten francs to the halberdier who had so bravely combatted
      the bull, and went up to the tree from which the recorder was fulminating
      his threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that you say, you scoundrel?&rdquo; said the baron, cracking his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; shouted the recorder, &ldquo;I say that the marshal will not leave this
      offence unpunished, and that on my arrival in Marseilles, I will tell him
      all, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Manjour!&rdquo; cried the baron, with another crack of the whip, &ldquo;I hope
      you will tell him all. I have received you in this way that you may tell
      him, indeed, that he may learn in what light I hold his orders,&rdquo; cried the
      old gentleman, unable to restrain his anger; &ldquo;the Provençal nobility has
      known how, in the last century, to drive from its province the insolent
      Duke d&rsquo;Epernon and his Gascons, as unworthy of governing it, and shall we
      not drive away a Vitry, a wretched assassin, who acts like an Italian
      bandit, who leaves our coasts without defence, who obliges us to protect
      ourselves, and then comes to take away from us the means of resisting the
      pirates! Get out of here, you rogue, and go to draw up your scrawls
      elsewhere than in my house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not get down!&rdquo; cried the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to smoke you out of the tree like a badger in the trunk of
      a willow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Believing Raimond V. capable of anything, Master Isnard slowly descended
      the tree. His clerk, who had remained silent, imitated his example, and
      reached the ground at the same time with his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said the baron, putting a few pieces of silver in the scribe&rsquo;s
      hand. &ldquo;You can drink to the health of the king, our count. All this is not
      your fault, clerk.&rdquo; &ldquo;I forbid you to accept one coin!&rdquo; cried the recorder.
      &ldquo;You shall be obeyed, Master Isnard,&rdquo; said the scribe. &ldquo;These are two
      silver crowns, and not one coin,&rdquo; and he pocketed the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will add in my report, sir, that you tried to corrupt my agents,&rdquo;
       said the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of here, out, out, you stinking beast!&rdquo; cried the baron, cracking his
      whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give people strange hospitality, Baron des Anbiez,&rdquo; said the
      recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reproach seemed to touch Raimond deeply; he said: &ldquo;Manjour! all the
      country knows that the lord and the peasant have found free refuge and
      loyal hospitality in this house. But I am and will be without pity for the
      petty tyrants of a tyrant cardinal. Out of here, I say, or I will whip you
      like a bad dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will sound well,&rdquo; cried the recorder, purple with rage, and walking
      backward toward the bridge, &ldquo;It will sound well that you have attempted
      the life of an officer of the king&rsquo;s justice, and that you have driven him
      away from your house with blows of the whip, instead of allowing him to
      execute peaceably the orders of his Eminence, the cardinal, and of the
      marshal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you can tell all that to your marshal, and you can add that, if
      he comes here, although my beard is gray, I engage to prove to him, sword
      in hand and dagger in fist, that he is nothing but a hired assassin, and
      that his master, the cardinal,&mdash;God preserve the king from him,&mdash;is
      only a sort of Christian pacha, a thousand times more a despot than the
      Turk. You can tell him, too, to beware of pushing us to extremes, because
      we can remember a noble prince, brother of a good and noble king, blinded
      for the moment by this false priest, cousin of Beelzebub. You can tell
      him, too, that the nobility of Provence, worn out by so many outrages,
      would rather have for their sovereign Count Gaston of Orleans, than the
      King of France, since at this time the King of France is Richelieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, baron,&rdquo; whispered the lord of Signerol, &ldquo;you are going too
      far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Manjour!&rdquo; cried the impetuous baron, &ldquo;my head can answer for my
      words; but I have an arm, thank God, able to defend my head. Out of here,
      you knave! Open your long ears well, and shut them well to keep what you
      hear. As for our cannon and ammunition, you will see nothing of them. We
      will renounce our arms when the dogs beg the wolves to cut off their paws
      and pull out their teeth. Out of here, I say; and repeat my words, and
      worse, too, if it seems good to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recorder, having reached the gate, rapidly crossed the bridge,
      followed by his clerk and his guards, and as he mounted his horse, hurled
      a thundering anathema at the house of the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V., delighted with the success of his trick, entered with his
      guests, and sat down to the table, as the hour of luncheon had just
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of the long day passed away in joy, in the midst of gay
      conversation arising from this adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      From one of the windows of the castle, Honorât de Berrol had witnessed
      this scene. Knowing the obstinacy of his future father-in-law, he had not
      attempted remonstrance, but he could not repress his fear when he thought
      of the imprudent words Raimond V. had uttered on the subject of Gaston of
      Orleans.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE BOHEMIAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many days had elapsed since Master Isnard had been driven so
      unceremoniously from Maison-Forte des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conduct of the baron toward the deputy of the marshal, the Duke of
      Vitry, had been generally approved by the nobility of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very small number of gentlemen had submitted to the orders of the
      governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard, established in a hostelry of La Ciotat, had despatched a
      messenger to Marseilles for the purpose of informing the marshal of the
      lively resistance he had encountered upon the subject of the census of
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The citizens generally ranged themselves on the side of the nobility and
      the clergy, who defended Provençal rights and privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three estates&mdash;the holy clergy, the illustrious nobility, and the
      Provençal republic and communities, as Cæsar de Nostradamus names them in
      his history of Provence&mdash;sustained themselves against a common enemy,
      which is to say, against any governor who attacked their privileges, or,
      in the opinion of the Proven-çals, was unworthy of governing their
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, transient divisions occurred between the nobility and the
      citizens when particular interests became involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard had arrived in La Ciotat at a time when some feeling of
      resentment against Raimond V. was being manifested.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the consuls of the town, Master Talebard-Talebardon, sustained in
      the name of the citizens a lawsuit against the baron, upon the subject of
      certain fishing-nets, which he claimed the lord of Anbiez had laid without
      legal right in a bay outside his privilege, and thereby was injuring the
      interests of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the inhabitants of La Ciotat had, on many occasions, found aid
      and support from the baron, although at the last descent of the pirates he
      had, at the head of his own household servants, fought valiantly, and
      almost saved the city, the gratitude of the citizens did not extend to an
      absolute submission to the will of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul Talebard-Talebardon, a personal enemy of the baron, always
      exaggerating the faults of this nobleman, had so envenomed the question,
      that great disaffection was already being manifested among the citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at this time, Master Isnard excited these dissensions, fanned the
      fire, and spoke at length of his cruel reception at Maison-Forte. Although
      he was not of the country, he succeeded in making the outrage done him
      appear as a question between the nobility and the citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder induced the consuls to withdraw within the limits of their
      dignity, and, instead of continuing the amicable negotiations already
      initiated, to insist upon the baron&rsquo;s appearance before the tribunal of
      overseers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This malevolent disposition once gaining ground, the malcontents did not
      stop there. They forgot the real services that Raimond V. had rendered to
      the city, his generous hospitality, the good that he was doing in the
      neighbourhood, to remember that he was abusive, hotheaded, and always
      ready to lift his rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      They exaggerated the havoc made by his dogs in the chase; they spoke of
      the brutal manner in which he had treated the citizens at the time of
      their complaint concerning the fishing-nets; in short, after the
      appearance of the recorder in La Ciotat, they began to speak of the Baron
      des Anbiez as a veritable feudal tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the storm was gathering on that side, the most perfect tranquillity
      reigned in Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. drank and hunted in the finest style, going through his domains
      almost every day, with an unequalled activity; he visited his neighbours
      at their country-seats, in order to preserve, as he said, the sacred fire,
      or, rather, the general opposition to the Marshal of Vitry, demanding from
      each one his signature, appended to a supplication addressed to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manifesto, or public declaration, the Provençal nobility formally
      demanded the recall of the marshal, reminding Louis XIII. that his father,
      of glorious memory, the great Henri, had, under similar circumstances,
      recalled the Duke d&rsquo;Epernon, in order to redress the just complaints of
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the nobility expressed, in this act, their respectful regrets not
      to be able to submit to the orders of the cardinal, in renouncing their
      right to arm their houses, inasmuch as their own safety required that they
      should always be in a state of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redoubling his activity, the baron regained, as he said, the legs and arms
      of twenty years, in this crusade against Marshal of Vitry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the moral aspect of Maison-Forte some days after the event of
      which we have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not forgotten the Bohemian, who, arriving in the train of the
      recorder, had, upon the baron&rsquo;s invitation, scaled the balcony in so agile
      and surprising a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make use of a particular and modern expression, the vagabond Bohemian
      had become quite the fashion in the rustic and warlike habitation of
      Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, he had mended numerous household utensils with
      remarkable skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Eclair, the favourite greyhound of the baron, put her paw out of
      joint, whereupon the Bohemian went up on the mountain and gathered certain
      herbs by the light of the moon, and carefully wrapped the sick member in
      them, and the next day Eclair was able to stretch her legs on the rosy
      heather of the baronial plains and valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not all. Mistraon, the favourite horse of Raimond V., was wounded
      in the frush of his foot by a sharp stone; by means of a thin layer of
      iron deftly inserted in the slope of the shoe, the Bohemian made a sort of
      Turkish horseshoe, which ever after preserved the invalid foot of Mistraon
      from all injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron doted on the Bohemian. Dame Dulceline herself, notwithstanding
      her holy horror of this unbeliever, who, never having been baptised, could
      not bear the name of Christian, relented somewhat when the unbeliever gave
      her marvellous recipes for colouring pieces of glass, stuffing birds, and
      making excellent cordials.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Abbé Mascarolus was not less under the charm, thanks to some
      pharmaceutic specifics of which the Bohemian had given him the secret. The
      only regret of the worthy chaplain was to find the vagabond so obstinate
      and shy upon the subject of his conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the serious side of the Bohemian&rsquo;s qualifications. To that he
      united the most versatile and agreeable accomplishments. He had in a
      little cage two beautiful pigeons, which showed an almost superhuman
      intelligence; his ass astonished the household of Maison-Forte by the
      grace with which he walked on his hind legs; besides, the Bohemian played
      with iron balls and daggers as well as the best juggler from India; he was
      as good a marksman as the most accomplished carabineer; and, finally, to
      conclude the enumeration of this vagabond&rsquo;s wonderful attractions, he sang
      charmingly, as he accompanied himself on a sort of Moorish guitar with
      three strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was doubtless to this talent that he owed the nickname of the &ldquo;Singer,&rdquo;
       by which he was known among his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette was the first to inform her mistress of the new troubadour; in
      fact, although he was rather ugly than handsome, the flexible and
      expressive features of the Bohemian seemed almost charming when he sang
      his soft and melancholy songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One must understand the calm, monotonous life of the inmates of
      Maison-Forte, to comprehend the success of the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine, beset by the entreaties of Stephanette, finally consented to hear
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât de Berrol, together with his betrothed, had made a visit to
      Marseilles, without the knowledge of Raimond V., to learn the results of
      the complaints entered by the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the baron had aught to fear from these complaints, Honorât was
      immediately to inform Reine, and employ the influence of one of her
      relatives, who was a friend of Marshal of Vitry, to subdue the resentment
      raised by the imprudent conduct of the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine hoped to find some distraction to her sad thoughts, by listening to
      the songs of the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image of the unknown hero haunted her more and more. The fantastical,
      mysterious circumstances, which had so strangely excited her memory,
      interested and frightened her at the same time; in the meanwhile,
      desiring, or, rather, thinking to put an end to this romantic adventure,
      she had, to the great joy of Honorât, fixed her marriage on the day
      following the festivity of Christmas, and yet, the nearer the day
      approached, the more she repented of her promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very depths of her heart she would ask herself with a vague fear if
      she no longer loved her betrothed as in the past. But this question
      remained unanswered; the young girl did not dare, so to speak, to listen
      to the response made by her conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine was seated in sad meditation in the little turret which served her
      as a drawing-room, when Stephanette entered and said to her mistress:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, here is the Singer; he is in the passage, shall I ask him
      to enter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo; said Reine, with indifference. &ldquo;For what purpose,
      mademoiselle? Why, to distract you from these witchcrafts which torment
      you. What a pity this unbeliever is an unbeliever! Really, mademoiselle,
      since he has left off his leather jerkin, and monseigneur has made him a
      present of a scarlet doublet, he looks like a gendarme, and more, too, he
      has a golden tongue, I answer for it. And I was obliged, if you please, to
      give him the flame-coloured ribbon I always wore around my head to fasten
      his collar, you see. Without that he would not dare, so he said, to
      present himself before mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, my dear, that you have sacrificed yourself,&rdquo; said Reine, smiling
      in spite of herself. &ldquo;I doubt if Luquin will congratulate you very much on
      this disinterested devotion. But where is this brave captain, and when
      will he return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening or to-morrow morning, mademoiselle; the fishermen met him
      near Trefus. He was obliged to lessen the speed of his tartan to
      accommodate the large ships that he was escorting from Nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think that he would like to have you give ribbons to this
      strolling singer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Our Lady! whether he likes it or not does not matter to me. If it is
      necessary to obtain some amusement for my dear mistress I would not
      hesitate for a cheap piece of ribbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Stephanette, Stephanette! you are a real coquette. I have seen the
      sharp black eyes of this vagabond looking into yours more than once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shows, mademoiselle, that he approves of Lu-quin&rsquo;s taste, and my
      captain ought to feel flattered by it,&rdquo; answered Stephanette, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong; you will make your betrothed angry,&rdquo; replied Reine, with a
      more serious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear mistress, cannot one love her betrothed faithfully and
      tenderly, and amuse herself with the flatteries of a vagabond foreigner,
      as you call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine took this response, to which Stephanette had attached no
      significance, as an allusion to her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her attendant sternly, and said, with an imperious air,
      &ldquo;Stephanette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pretty, innocent face of the young girl suddenly assumed an expression
      of such sadness as she raised her large eyes, in which a tear glittered,
      full of a grieved surprise to her mistress, that Reine extended her hand
      to her and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, you are a foolish but a good and honest girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette, smiling through her tears, kissed the hand of her mistress
      with affectionate gratitude, and said, as she wiped her eyes with the end
      of her slender fingers: &ldquo;Shall I tell the Singer to come in,
      mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go and tell him, since you wish it; let the sacrifice of your
      flame-coloured ribbon do some good at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette smiled with an mischievous air, went out, and returned
      followed by the Bohemian.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE GUZIAC OF THE EMIR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the humility of his position, the Bohemian did not appear
      to be much intimidated in the presence of Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saluted her with a sort of easy respect as he took a sharp and rapid
      survey of the objects which surrounded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Stephanette had remarked, the Singer&rsquo;s exterior had greatly improved;
      his slender and well-formed figure looked wonderfully well in the scarlet
      doublet, the present from the baron; his collar was fastened with the
      flame-coloured ribbon, a present from Stephanette; he wore wide trousers
      of coarse white stuff; his dark blue gaiters, embroidered with red wool,
      reached above his knees. His black hair enframed a thin, sunburnt but
      intelligent face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held in his hand a kind of guitar with a neck of ebony expensively
      inlaid with gold and mother-of-pearl; at its upper end the neck formed a
      sort of palette, in the middle of which was a small, round plate chased
      with gold, resembling the lid of a medallion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We emphasise the costliness of this instrument because it seemed very
      strange that a strolling Bohemian should be its possessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette herself was struck with it, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Singer, I never saw that beautiful guitar before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words attracted the attention of Reine, and, as surprised as her
      maid, she said to the Bohemian:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, this is a very expensive instrument for a travelling artisan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am poor, mademoiselle, sometimes I have wanted bread, but ah! I would
      rather die of hunger than sell this guzla. My arms are weak, but they
      would become as strong as brass to defend this guzla. They would only take
      it from me after my death. It is my most precious treasure; I hardly dare
      to play it. But the rose of Anbiez wishes to hear me; all that I now
      desire is that my song may be worthy of the instrument and of her who
      listens to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian spoke French quite purely, although he had something guttural
      in his Arabian accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine exchanged a glance of surprise with her attendant, as she heard this
      florid Oriental speech, which contrasted singularly with the condition of
      the wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this guzla, as you call this instrument, how did you come to possess
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian shook his head sadly, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a sad story, mademoiselle; there are more tears than smiles in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us,&mdash;tell us!&rdquo; exclaimed Reine, deeply interested in the
      romantic turn the incident had taken. &ldquo;Relate to us how this guzla came
      into your hands. You seem to be above your present condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian uttered a profound sigh, fixed a piercing look on Reine, and
      struck a few chords which vibrated a long time under the arched roof of
      the turret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me the story of this guzla,&rdquo; said Reine, with the impatience of
      a young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wanderer, without replying, made a supplicating gesture. He began to
      sing, accompanying himself with taste, or, rather, playing softly some air
      of tender melancholy, while, with a sweet and grave tone, he recited the
      following stanzas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/138.jpg" alt="He Began to Sing " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Although it lacked rhythm and rhyme, the language had a certain strange
      charm; he rendered in a sort of recitative the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far is the country where I was born; the sands of the desert surround it
      like an arid sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lived there with my mother: she was poor, she was old, she was blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved my mother, as the unhappy love those who love them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was sad, sad, very sad, after she had lost her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went into the valley to look for flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She tried to console herself for not seeing their smiling faces by
      inhaling their perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voice of a son is always sweet to the ear of a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke to her; sometimes she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never to see! never to see! that filled her with sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sank by degrees into a mute despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before sinking into this despair, leaning on my arm, she went out; she
      loved to go at set of sun and sit under the orange-trees in the garden of
      the young and brave emir of our tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentle warmth of the sun revived my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loved to listen to the murmur of the cascades, which seemed to sing
      as they fell into the basin of marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day, when she lamented more bitterly than ever the loss of her sight,
      she refused to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prayed her; I wept; she was inflexible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seated in the most solitary corner of our dwelling, her venerable head
      wrapped in her black mantle, she remained motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She no longer desired to eat; she wished to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one long, for one long night, she refused everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In vain I said: &lsquo;My mother, my mother, like you also I shall die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She remained silent and gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took her hand, her hand already frozen. I tried to warm it with my
      breath: she wished to withdraw her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In saying these words, the voice of the Bohemian had such an expression of
      sadness, and the sounds that he drew from his guzla were so melancholy,
      that Reine and Stephanette silently exchanged glances suffused with tears.
      The Bohemian continued without perceiving the emotion he had excited:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet a beautiful night Through the open window of our house one saw
      the starlit sky; the moon covered the plain with silver; one heard no
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh, yes! one heard the fevered breathing of my poor mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly in the distance, far, very far, a light noise sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like the soft and gentle echo of a voice singing in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon a gentle breeze, burdened with the perfume of the citron-tree,
      wafted sounds more distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was still holding the icy hand of my mother. I felt her tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This celestial voice approached&mdash;approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chords of a melodious instrument accompanied it, and gave it an
      inexpressible charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother started again; she raised her head; she listened. For the first
      time in many hours she gave signs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the enchanting sounds approached my mother seemed bom again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt her hand grow warm again; I felt her hand press mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard her voice at last; her voice till then so mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My child, these songs sink in my soul; they calm me! Tears, oh, tears!
      Yes, tears at last! I had so much need to weep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I felt two burning tears fall on my brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, my mother, my mother!&rsquo; &lsquo;Silence, my child, be silent!&rsquo; said she,
      putting one of her hands upon my mouth, and pointing to the window with
      the other. &lsquo;Listen to the voice! listen! there it is! there it is!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine, deeply moved, pressed the hand of Stephanette as she shook her head
      with a touching expression of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moon of my country shines as the sun of this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In its light slowly passed the young emir, mounted on Azib, his beautiful
      white horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Azib, gentle as a lamb, courageous as a lion, white as a swan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The emir let his reins fall on the neck of Azib. Happy, he sang of a
      happy love, and accompanied himself on his guzla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His songs were not joyous: they were tender; they were melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He passed, singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Silence, child, silence!&rsquo; whispered my mother, pressing my hand
      convulsively. &lsquo;That voice divine does me so much good!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hélas! by degrees the voice died away; the emir had passed; the voice was
      gone; then one heard nothing more,&mdash;nothing more; not a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, I fall back in the dreadful horror of my night,&rsquo; said my mother.
      &lsquo;This celestial music seemed to dissipate the darkness. Alas! alas!&rsquo; and
      she wrung her hands in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! all night she wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The morrow her despair increased; her reason grew feeble. In her delirium
      she called me a wicked son. She accused me of silencing this voice. If she
      heard this voice no more, she must die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was, indeed, going to die. For many hours she refused all
      nourishment. What could I do? What could I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The emir of our tribe was the most powerful of emirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he raised his djerid ten thousand cavaliers mounted horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His palace was worthy of the sultan, his treasures immense. Alas! how
      could I dare conceive the thought of saying to him, &lsquo;Come, and by your
      songs snatch an old and despairing woman from death?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet that I dared. My mother had perhaps but a few more hours to live.
      I went to the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the emir?&rdquo; cried Reine, deeply moved and interested, while
      Stephanette, not less excited than her mistress, clasped her hands in
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian gave the two young girls a glance of indescribable sadness,
      and said, interrupting this kind of improvising, and laying his instrument
      on his knees: &ldquo;&lsquo;My mother was a woman,&rsquo; said the emir to me, and he came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came!&rdquo; exclaimed Reine, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Ah, the noble heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, the most noble of noble hearts,&rdquo; repeated the Bohemian, with
      transport; &ldquo;he deigned, he so grand, he so powerful, to come, for five
      days, every evening into our poor dwelling. How shall I tell you of his
      touching, almost filial kindness? Alas, if my mother had not been stricken
      with a mortal disease, the songs of the emir would have saved her, for the
      effect they produced on her was wonderful. But she died at last without
      suffering, in a profound ecstasy. This guzla, it once belonged to the
      emir; he gave it to me. Thanks to it the last moments of my mother were
      peaceful,&mdash;poor mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tear glittered a moment in the black eye of the Bohemian; then, as if he
      wished to drive away these painful memories, he took up his guzla quickly
      and recited these other stanzas in a proud and excited voice, as he made
      his sonorous instrument resound:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name of the emir is sacred in his tribe; let him but speak and we
      will die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one is more brave; not one is more beautiful; not one is more noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is hardly twenty years old, and his name is already the terror of
      other tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His arm is delicate like that of a woman, but it is strong like that of a
      warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His face is smiling, is beautiful like that of the spirit who appears in
      the dreams of young girls; but it is sometimes terrible like that of the
      god of battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His voice charms and seduces like a magic philter, but sometimes it
      bursts forth like a clarion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his enthusiasm, the Bohemian approached Reine and said to her, as he
      opened the medallion set into the neck of the guzla: &ldquo;See! see if he is
      not the most beautiful of mortals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl looked at the portrait, and uttered a cry of surprise,
      almost of terror. The portrait was that of the stranger in the rocks of
      Ollioules, who had saved the life of her father!
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door of Reine&rsquo;s drawing-room was opened, and she saw
      before her Honorât de Berrol, followed by Captain Luquin Trinquetaille,
      who had just arrived from Nice on the tartan, <i>The Holy Terror of the
      Moors, by the Grace of God</i>.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. JEALOUSY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Honorât de Berrol entered Reine&rsquo;s apartment, Stephanette wished to
      retire so as to leave the two lovers alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took one step toward the door, but Reine said to her, quickly, in a
      voice full of emotion, &ldquo;Remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, scarcely able to control her feelings, she bowed her head and hid
      her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât, astonished beyond expression, did not know what to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian had closed the medallion containing the portrait of Erebus,
      and had placed it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the <i>Holy Terror to the Moors</i> vainly tried to catch
      Stephanette&rsquo;s eye, but she seemed as anxious to avoid his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luquin Trinquetaille was the more sensible of her conduct inasmuch as he
      recognised on the Bohemian&rsquo;s collar the flame-coloured ribbon, which was
      the exact counterpart of what Stephanette wore on her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      This observation on his part, together with several perfidious
      insinuations made by Master Laramée, who had just been taking a glass with
      Luquin, suddenly aroused the lover&rsquo;s jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the Singer angrily, then, meeting Ste-phanette&rsquo;s eyes by
      chance, he executed a most complicated pantomime with his left hand, which
      was meant to ask the young girl why the Singer had a ribbon like the one
      hanging from her ruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this pantomimic performance made it necessary for the worthy captain to
      put his hand to his collar quite often, Stephanette whispered to him, with
      the most innocent tone in the world, &ldquo;Are you suffering from a sore
      throat, M. Luquin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words of the mischievous girl, while they excited the captain&rsquo;s
      anger, seemed also to arouse Honorât from the astonishment produced by the
      strange reception of his betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached her, and said: &ldquo;I am just from Marseilles, Reine, and I must
      speak to you on some very serious things concerning your father.
      Trinquetaille comes from La Ciotat and tells me that the affair of the
      fishery is threatening; the citizens seem to be irritated. In order to
      talk of all this we must be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Reine raised her face bathed with tears, and with a sign
      ordered Stephanette to go out The girl obeyed, casting a sad look at her
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trinquetaille followed his betrothed with a very ungracious air, and the
      Bohemian accompanied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reine, in the name of Heaven, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; cried
      Honorât, as soon as he was alone with Mlle, des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&mdash;nothing is the matter with me, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are weeping, your face is all tear-stained. What has happened,
      pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I tell you,&mdash;mere childishness. The Bohemian sang a romance
      of his country for us; it was pathetic, and I allowed myself to be
      affected by it. But do not let us talk of this nonsense; let us talk of
      father. Is there any danger? Has his angry treatment of the recorder
      irritated the marshal? And what does Luquin say about the fishery?
      Honorât! Honorât! do answer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Reine; although those matters have assumed a grave, if not
      a dangerous aspect, let me first speak of what is above everything else,&mdash;my
      love for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Honorât! Honorât! what of my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be calm, there is no immediate danger threatening the baron. The marshal
      has despatched two of his men to make inquiries about the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does Luquin say about the fishery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes to tell you that the consuls have returned the question with
      your father on the right of fishery to the overseers; so you see, Reine,
      that this news, although serious, has nothing threatening or alarming in
      it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you think the marshal will consider my father&rsquo;s conduct?&rdquo; said
      Reine, hurriedly, again interrupting Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover looked at her with as much surprise as sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, Reine, what does that signify? Are we not to be united in a few
      days? at Christmas? Is it tiresome to you to hear me speak of my love for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine uttered a sigh, and looked down without replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Reine,&rdquo; cried Honorât, with bitterness; &ldquo;for a month now, there
      is something in you which is inexplicable; you are no longer the same, you
      are distracted, preoccupied, taciturn; when I speak to you of our
      approaching marriage, of our plans, of our future, you answer me with
      constraint. Again I say, this is not natural. What have you to reproach me
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;oh, nothing, nothing, Honorât, you are the best, the
      noblest of men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, indeed, only eight days ago, you yourself formally announced to your
      father your desire that our marriage should take place at Christmas, even
      if circumstances should prevent the attendance of your uncles, the
      commander and Father Elzear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, have you changed your mind? Do you wish to postpone it? You
      do not answer me. My God! what does that mean? Reine, Reine! Ah, I am
      unhappy indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, do not despond so; have pity on me. Wait, I am foolish. I am
      unworthy of your affection. I annoy you,&mdash;you are so good, so noble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me what is the matter with you? What do you wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. I suffer&mdash;I&mdash;Wait, I tell you. I am foolish and
      weak and very miserable, believe me.&rdquo; She hid her face in her hands.
      Honorât, at the height of astonishment, looked at her with an expression
      of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;if I were less acquainted with the purity of your heart,
      if evidence even did not prevent the least suspicion, I would believe that
      a rival had supplanted me in your affection. But no, no, if that were
      true, I know your sincerity,&mdash;you would confess it to me without a
      blush, because you are incapable of making an unworthy choice. But then,
      what is it? A month ago, you loved me so much, so you said,&mdash;what
      have I done in one month to deserve such punishment from you? Ah, it is
      enough to make one insane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Honorât de Berrol, a prey to violent grief, plunged almost into
      despair, walked up and down the room in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine, overwhelmed, did not dare utter a word. She was almost on the point
      of confessing all to Honorât, but shame restrained her, and besides, she
      could not distinctly understand her own impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recital by the Bohemian, the wonderful accident which had just placed
      the portrait of the unknown before her eyes, increased the curiosity and
      romantic interest that she felt concerning the stranger, in spite of
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was this sentiment love? Again, who was this man? The Bohemian called
      him the emir of his tribe, but at Marseilles, he and his two companions
      had passed for Muscovites; how could the truth be unveiled among so many
      mysteries? And then, would she ever see him again? Was it not idolatry?
      Was the pathetic incident related by the Bohemian true?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in this chaos of confused thoughts, Reine could not find one word to
      reply to Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      What good could be accomplished by confessing this inexplicable secret? If
      she had felt her affection for her betrothed diminish or change, with her
      usual fidelity she would not have hesitated to have told him, but she felt
      for him the same calm, gentle tenderness, the same confidence, the same
      timid veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If sometimes when he was leaving Maison-Forte, Honorât, encouraged by
      Raimond V., would press his lips upon the young girl&rsquo;s brow, she would
      smile without giving the slightest evidence of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in her manner betrayed a change in her attachment to Honorât, and
      yet she saw the day of her marriage approach with distrust and even
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless this want of confidence in Honorât was censurable, but she
      divined with true feminine instinct the danger and uselessness of telling
      her betrothed the strange restlessness of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât appeared to be deeply grieved. Reine reproached herself for not
      being able to utter a word to cheer him. Once she was about to obey the
      inspiration of her compassion for him and tell him all in perfect
      confidence, but his irritated manner arrested the words on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his vain effort to discover the cause of the coldness and capricious
      conduct of Reine, and suddenly struck by some vague memories, as he
      recalled that, for a month past, the Seigneur de Signerol had been
      visiting Maison-Forte more frequently than was his habit, Honorât
      foolishly suspected this man to be the object of Reine&rsquo;s preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea was all the more absurd, as the young girl, in talking with her
      betrothed the day of the recorder&rsquo;s adventure, had blamed the Seigneur de
      Signerol in almost contemptuous terms, accusing him of exciting the
      impetuous temper of her father. As for Seigneur de Signerol, he had never
      had a conversation with Mile, des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât, however, in his state of irritation and distress, welcomed any
      suspicion which seemed to explain the strange attitude of Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once admitting this suspicion into his heart, he then became indignant at
      the contemptuous manner in which she had spoken of this man, seeing in her
      language nothing but the most perfidious dissimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Reine was doubly culpable in his eyes. Why did she not frankly
      reject his hand, instead of keeping him in doubtful hope? Accepting this
      false theory, Honorât de Berrol found only too many reasons to induce him
      to ponder the caprices which he had observed in the conduct of Reine for
      some time. He even went so far as to imagine that the Bohemian was an
      emissary of M. de Signerol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent agitation of his betrothed at the time he entered her
      drawing-room confirmed him in this absurd opinion. Not being able to hide
      this impression, he said to her, suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess, mademoiselle, that it is at least rather strange that you should
      receive a vagabond Bohemian in your apartment; it seems to me that if he
      had only come to sing, you would not have been so embarrassed, so excited
      when I entered here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honorât, in his anger, made this remark at random, and as soon as the
      words were uttered, felt ashamed of them. But what was his astonishment,
      his vexation, his distress, to see Reine blush and cast down her eyes
      without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking of the portrait of the unknown hero, and the adventure
      connected with him; she was ignorant of Honorât&rsquo;s allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The embarrassment of the young girl confirmed the chevalier in his
      suspicions, and he exclaimed, with bitterness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Reine, never could I have believed you capable of forgetting yourself
      so far as to compromise your dearest interests by trusting them to such a
      contemptible creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Honorât? I do not understand you. This is the first
      time I have ever heard you utter such words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the first time that I have had the assurance that I was your
      plaything!&rdquo; cried he, unable to restrain his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you do not mean what you say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, yes, I mean that now I can explain your hesitation, your
      constraint, your embarrassment; but what I cannot explain, is that you
      could have the cruelty to play this disgraceful rôle toward a man who has
      devoted his entire life to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Honorât, you are losing your senses! I do not deserve your
      reproaches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of two things: either a month ago you thought of our marriage, or you
      think no longer of it. If you think no longer of it, you have played with
      the love of an honest man; if you still intend to fulfil it, in spite of
      the love which you have now in your heart, why, it is detestable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although Honorat&rsquo;s suspicions were absurd, Reine, struck by these words,
      which offered some solution to the situation, kept silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât interpreted this silence as a confession of her duplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You answer nothing,&mdash;you cannot answer! I was not mistaken then!
      This Bohemian is the secret emissary of M. de Signerol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of M. de Signerol!&rdquo; exclaimed Reine. &ldquo;But you cannot think it I have
      never addressed a word to that man except in the presence of my father.
      Besides, you know very well the opinion that I have expressed of him.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;The better to dissimulate this beautiful preference, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Signerol! M. de Signerol! indeed, you are silly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us discontinue this comedy, mademoiselle. My eyes have not left you
      for a moment I observed your embarrassment, your blushes even, when I
      spoke of the Bohemian to you. Let us discontinue this comedy, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Either pride, distress, or vexation that she could not explain the cause
      of her embarrassment, or the pain that she felt at the bitter words of
      Honorât, incited Reine to hold up her head with dignity and say to her
      betrothed: &ldquo;You are right, Honorât, let us discontinue such a discussion;
      it is little worthy of you or of me. Since you judge me so unjustly, since
      upon the most foolish suspicions you base the most dishonouring
      accusation, I give your promise back to you, and take back mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah!
      that was your intention, no doubt, mademoiselle. All this has been
      necessary to force me to give you back your freedom. Ah, well, let it be
      so! Let all the plans of happiness upon which I have staked my whole life
      be forgotten; let the dearest wishes of your father and your family be
      trampled under foot! You have enough influence over the baron to make him
      yield to your designs. I assure you I will not in any way oppose them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, they heard the spurred heels of Raimond V., who
      precipitately entered, holding a paper in his hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE SUMMONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Raimond V. was far too angry to notice the expression of sadness and grief
      that was depicted on the countenances of the two betrothed. Addressing
      Honorât, he said, in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manjour! do you know, forsooth, what Trinquetaille has just informed me?
      Would you believe, my son, that the citizens of La Ciotat, those vile
      swine that have fattened on my bounty and that I have saved from the teeth
      of Barbary dogs, wish to summon me, to-morrow morning, before the
      overseers of the port, on the matter of our fishery contest! And the abbé
      pretends that&mdash;&rdquo; Then, returning to the door, the baron called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But come on, abbé, where in the devil have you hid yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good chaplain showed his tall form among the folds of the portière,
      for he had been discreetly waiting in the antechamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The abbé,&rdquo; continued Raimond V., &ldquo;pretends that this fine tribunal is
      sovereign, if you please,&mdash;a tribunal composed of old man Cadaou, a
      fish vender, and some other triton garlic eaters, who hardly own, among
      them all, one boat or net. Manjour! my children, think of my being placed
      under a ban by those old scoundrels!&rdquo; &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Abbé Mascarolus,
      &ldquo;the decision of the overseers of the port on all matters pertaining to
      the fisheries is supreme, and without appeal. It has been confirmed by the
      patent letters of Henry II. in 1537, by Charles IX. in 1564, and by the
      king, our count, in 1622. It is one of the oldest customs of the Provençal
      community. There is no instance of a nobleman, priest, or citizen who has
      set it aside, and, monseigneur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, abbé, enough!&rdquo; rudely interrupted the baron. &ldquo;If they have the
      impudence to summon me, I shall not have the weakness to obey their
      summons, even when it is made in virtue of all the kings the abbé has just
      declared to us. As to the patents of the kings, I will oppose titles and
      privileges conceded by other kings to my house for services rendered to
      them, as an offset, and my seines and nets will stay where they are, and,
      by the devil, I will take care that they do stay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, permit me,&rdquo; said Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur? Eh! Why in the devil do you call me monsieur? Am I not your
      father?&rdquo; cried the baron, looking at Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât cast a distressed look at Reine, as if to make her understand that
      it was due to her that he could no longer call the baron by the tender
      name of father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât replied, in a voice trembling with emotion, &ldquo;Ah, well, since you
      wish it, my father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, come now, what is the matter, pray?&rdquo; asked the astonished baron of
      his daughter. &ldquo;Eh! Of course I wish you to call me father, since you are,
      or will be, my son in a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine blushed, looked down, and remained silent. &ldquo;Ah, well, come, speak
      now, I pray you,&rdquo; said the old gentleman to Honorât. &ldquo;What have you to
      tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I have learned,&rdquo; answered Honorât, &ldquo;the consuls, excited by the
      recorder Isnard, have manifested some hostility to you, father; do you not
      fear that the citizens and fishers may join these wicked people, when they
      see that you refuse to appear, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, afraid of those scoundrels! Why, I laugh at them as I would at a
      broken spur,&rdquo; cried the old gentleman, impetuously. &ldquo;I have, from father
      to son, the right to lay my seines and nets in the cove of Castrembaou. I
      will maintain my right, even if all the fishers on the coast, from here to
      Sixfours, oppose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;that however much they may
      contest it, you have the right. Your titles and privileges of fishery date
      back to the year 1221, the 14th day of February, under the reign of
      Philippe, King of France, and your claims have been registered by Bertrand
      de Cornillon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what do I want with the authority of Bertrand de Cornillon!&rdquo; cried
      the baron. &ldquo;Power makes the right, and I have the force to sustain the
      right. Man-jour! did ever one see such trickery? What rascals! I, who have
      always helped them, and defended them! Ah, just let them come and talk to
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear father, they would find you still, as they have always found
      you, generous and kind and&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;I believe it, certainly; how could I
      revenge myself on such boobies, if it was not by showing them that a
      gentleman is of better stock than they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I recognise all that very well, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the abbé. &ldquo;If the
      overseers could only examine your titles&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, examine my titles! I have driven away with my whip a recorder sent
      by a duke and a peer, a marshal of France, and I must go and submit to the
      arbitration of those old tar-jackets, who will descend from their wretched
      boats to mount their tribunal? I must go and take off my hat before those
      old scoundrels, who the very morning of their audience have cried in the
      port, &lsquo;Buy&mdash;buy&mdash;soup&mdash;fish&mdash;buy&mdash;buy,&rsquo;&mdash;a
      people that my family has loaded with benefits. In his last voyage to
      Algiers to redeem captives, did not my brave and good brother, Elzear,
      bring back from Barbary five inhabitants of La Ciotat? Did not my brother,
      the commander, three years ago, chase away with his black galley five or
      six chebecs from the coast, because they were interfering with these
      fishermen, and make them fly before him like a cloud of sparrows before a
      falcon? And these are the people who accuse me! Let them go to the devil!
      Let them send me their recorder, and they will see how I shall receive
      him. I have just had a new lash put on my whip! But enough of these
      miseries. Give me your arm, my daughter. The weather is fine; we will
      promenade. Come with us, Honorât.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me, father; I am needed at home, and I shall not be able
      to accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse. Go, then, quick, so as to come back quicker still. I
      fear nothing from these idiot sheep penned up in La Ciotat, but if they
      make any attempts upon my fishing-nets, I shall need you to keep me from
      making Laramée hang several of them over my nets as scarecrows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the baron, yielding to his changing and impetuous moods, altered his
      tone, and said, gaily, to the abbé, &ldquo;Now, abbé, if I had some of these
      insolent rascals hanged, it would be serious, because I do not think you
      have in all your pharmacy a remedy for hanging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, monseigneur, but I have been told that if you make the
      patient, before his execution, drink a great quantity of iron water,
      which, so to speak, envelopes and saturates the vital principle, and if,
      on the other hand, the patient will apply to his naked skin some large
      magnetic stones, or a loadstone, the power of the said stone is such that,
      in spite of the hanging, he will retain the vital principle in his body,
      for reason of the irresistible power of attraction possessed by this
      metal. I would not dare affirm it, but I have been recently told of this
      remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Our Lady, that is a wonderful remedy, eh! Who informed you of it,
      abbé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor man, who gives very little thought to the welfare of his soul, but
      who knows many beautiful recipes,&mdash;it is the Bohemian who healed your
      greyhound, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Singer, Manjour! I imagine he occupies himself with the hanged and
      with hanging; he thinks of his future, you see. Each one preaches his own
      saint, does he not, abbé?&mdash;which does not prevent this vagabond being
      a skilful man. Never a better farrier lifted the foot of a hunting-horse
      than this same Bohemian,&rdquo; added Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she heard the vagabond mentioned, Reine blushed again, and Honorât
      could scarcely repress a gesture of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dame Dulceline is enchanted with him; she tells me that, thanks to him,
      she will have a magnificent cradle for Christmas. But you have heard him
      sing, my daughter, what do you think of it? Because I am a bad judge, I am
      not acquainted with any songs but those the abbé sings, and our old
      Provençal refrains. Is it true that this wanderer has a wonderful voice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wishing to put an end to a conversation which, for many reasons, was
      painful to her, Reine replied to her father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, he sings very well. I have scarcely heard him. But if you wish
      to do so, father, we will take our promenade; it is two o&rsquo;clock already,
      and the days are short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron descended, followed by his daughter. In passing through the
      court, he saw through the half-open door of the coach-house the ancient
      and heavy carriage he always used when he attended service in the
      parochial church of La Ciotat, at the solemn festivals of the year,
      although he had his own chapel at Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing the kind of antipathy which prevailed against him in the little
      city, the bold and obstinate old baron took the ingenious idea of braving
      public opinion by going to church next day with a certain pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine&rsquo;s astonishment was unspeakable when she heard her father order
      Laramée to have this, carriage ready next day at midday, the hour of high
      mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      To every question of his daughter, the baron replied only by a persistent
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us return to less important actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she left the apartment of her mistress with Luquin, Stephanette had
      disdained to reply to the jealous suspicions of the captain, and had shut
      herself up in her dignity and her chamber. The windows of this chamber
      looked out into the court. The young girl saw through the windows the
      preparation of the old carriage, and, too, Luquin Trinquetaille, as he
      walked back and forth in a very agitated state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it curiosity to know what extraordinary event induced the baron to go
      out in this carriage, or was it a desire to obtain an interview with the
      captain? Whatever it was, Stephanette descended into the court She first
      addressed Master Laramée.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is monseigneur going out in this carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know is, that monseigneur ordered me to have this old Noah&rsquo;s ark
      ready. And, speaking of Noah&rsquo;s ark,&rdquo; added Laramée, with a sneering,
      satirical air, &ldquo;if you have an olive-branch in your pretty little
      rose-coloured beak, you ought to bear it as a sign of peace to that Abrave
      captain you see there measuring the court with his long legs like he was
      possessed. They say that he is at open war with the Bohemian, and the
      olive-branch is a symbol of peace that would flatter the worthy Captain
      Luquin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not ask you anything about that, Master Laramée,&rdquo; said Stephanette,
      with a dry tone. &ldquo;Where is monseigneur going in that carriage? Is it
      to-day or to-morrow that he wishes to use it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow will be to-day, and after to-morrow will be to-morrow,
      mademoiselle,&rdquo; bluntly replied the majordomo, offended by the imperious
      manner of Stephanette, and he added, between his teeth: &ldquo;There is a dove
      transformed into a speckled magpie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation, Luquin Trinquetaille had approached Stephanette.
      The captain tried to assume a cold, dignified, and disdainful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little one,&rdquo; said he, in a very careless tone, &ldquo;do you not think
      flame colour a very pretty colour?&rdquo; Stephanette turned her head, and,
      looking behind her, said to Luquin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dear little one? If you are talking to Jeannette, the laundress,
      that I see down there, you had better speak louder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not speaking to Jeannette, do you understand?&rdquo; cried Luquin, losing
      patience. &ldquo;Jeannette, laundress as she is, would not have the boldness,
      the effrontery, to give a ribbon to a vagabond Bohemian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is it, is it?&rdquo; said the mischievous girl. &ldquo;Really, this ribbon
      has the same effect on you, that a scarlet streamer has on a bull from
      Camargne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a bull from Camargue, with double horns, this vagabond would
      feel the point of them. But no matter, this miscreant shall pay for his
      insolence; may I die, if I do not cut off his ears and nail them to the
      mast of my tartan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his tongue, rather, that you ought to be jealous of, my poor
      Luquin, for never a troubadour of the good King René sang more sweetly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tear out his tongue, then,&mdash;a hundred thousand devils!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, do not do anything absurd, Luquin. The Bohemian is as courageous
      and expert as a gendarme.&rdquo; &ldquo;Many thanks for your pity, mademoiselle, but I
      do not fight with dogs, I beat them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but sometimes the dog has good teeth which bite very hard, I warn
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse me, if you are not the most diabolical creature I ever knew!&rdquo; cried
      Trinquetaille. &ldquo;I believe, by St. Elmo, my patron, that if I were to fight
      to-morrow in camp with this copper face, you would say: &lsquo;Our Lady for the
      Bohemian!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, I would say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Ought I not to take the part of the weak against the strong,&mdash;the
      small against the great? Ought I not at least to encourage the poor man
      who would dare challenge the formidable, unconquerable arm of the captain
      of <i>The Holy Terror to the Moors?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Cross! you are jesting, Stephanette, and I have no desire for it
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very evident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this good-for-nothing fellow, this vagabond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to go at once and find out? No inquiry would be more
      agreeable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too much, you are making sport of me. Ah, well, good-bye! All is
      over, you understand, all is over between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette shrugged her shoulders, and said, &ldquo;Why do you talk nonsense
      like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt, mere imagination and pretence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretence! Ah, you think so? Pretence! Ah, well, you will see. Do not
      think you can take me with your cajoleries. I know them,&mdash;crocodile
      tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say that, Luquin. I am going to force you to get on your knees
      before me and ask my pardon for your stupid jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, on my knees! I, ask your pardon! Ah, that would be pretty! Ah, ah, I
      on my knees before you!&rdquo; &ldquo;On both knees, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah, the idea is a pleasant one, on my word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, this very instant,&mdash;here, on this spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, you are crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Luquin, in your own interest, do it now, I pray you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, la, la, la, la,&rdquo; said the captain, singing between his teeth, and
      keeping time by rising on his toes and falling back on his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, twice, will you get on your knees and ask my pardon for your stupid
      jealousy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather, you can understand, strangle myself with my own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luquin, you know that when I wish a thing, I wish it. If you refuse what
      I ask, I will be the one to say good-bye to you. And I will not come back,
      either, remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, go; perhaps you will meet the Bohemian on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette did not answer a word, but turned around abruptly and walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luquin was very brave for a few moments, then his courage failed him, and
      at last, seeing that the young girl walked with a firm, resolute step, he
      followed her and called, in a supplicating voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl walked faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanette, Stephanette, do be reasonable, you know very well that I
      love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette continued to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand devils! Is it possible for me to ask your pardon for my
      jealousy, when I have seen that&mdash;&rdquo; Stephanette quickened her step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanette, ah, well, come now, in truth you bewitch me. You make me do
      all that you wish.&rdquo; Stephanette slackened her step a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To come to the point, no, a thousand times no, I am weaker than a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette began to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of <i>The Holy Terror to the Moors</i> was obliged to exercise
      his long, heron-like legs to catch up with her, as he said, with a stifled
      voice, &ldquo;Ah, well, come now, diabolical creature that you are,&mdash;one
      must do as you wish,&mdash;here I am on my knees,&mdash;only stop a
      moment. Ah, well, yes, I was wrong. Are you satisfied? Is it possible to
      be so base?&rdquo; murmured Luquin, in parenthesis; then he said, aloud: &ldquo;Ah,
      well, yes, I was wrong to be jealous of&mdash;of&mdash;But at least stop,
      will you not? I cannot run after you on my knees. I was wrong, I tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette slackened her gait a little, then stopped still, and said to
      Luquin, without turning her head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your knees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am; I am on my knees. Fortunately for my dignity as a man, that
      corner of the wall hides me from the eyes of that old gossip of a
      majordomo,&rdquo; said Luquin to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repeat after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but do turn your head, Stephanette, so I can see you; that will give
      me courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repeat, repeat first; come, say, &lsquo;I was wrong to be jealous of that poor
      Bohemian.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I was wrong to be jealous of&mdash;that&mdash;humph&mdash;of that
      scoundrel of a Bohemian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not it,&mdash;&lsquo;of that poor Bohemian.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that poor Bohemian,&rdquo; repeated Luquin, with a profound sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was a very innocent thing for Stephanette to give him a ribbon.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;humph&mdash;it was a very innocent thing for Stephanette&mdash;humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words seemed to strangle the captain, who coughed violently,&mdash;&ldquo;Humph,
      humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a very bad cold, my poor Luquin. Repeat now: &lsquo;It was a very
      innocent thing for Stephanette to give him a ribbon.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give him a ribbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; &lsquo;because I have her heart. And all this is only a young girl&rsquo;s
      folly, and I know well that she loves nobody but her Luquin,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
      Stephanette, rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without giving her betrothed time to rise and repeat these sweet
      words, Stephanette turned around quickly while he was still on his knees,
      and gave him a kiss on the forehead, and then disappeared through a
      passage in the court before the worthy captain, as delighted as surprised,
      had been able to take a step.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. THE OVERSEERS OF THE PORT
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the instigation of Master Isnard, still implacable, for reason of the
      inhospitable reception given to him by Raimond V., the consul,
      Talebard-Talebardon, on Saturday evening despatched a clerk to
      Maison-Forte des Anbiez, for the purpose of informing the baron that he
      was to appear the next day, Sunday, before the overseers of the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. made the trembling clerk sit down to the table and take supper
      with him, but every time the man of the law opened his mouth to ask the
      baron to appear before the tribunal, the old gentleman would cry out,
      &ldquo;Laramée, pour out some wine for my guest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he had the clerk taken back to La Ciotat somewhat intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interpreting the conduct of the baron according to their own view, Master
      Isnard and the consul saw in his refusal to answer their summons the most
      outrageous contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, which was Sunday, after the mass, at which, notwithstanding
      his resolution the evening before, the baron did not appear, the consuls
      and the recorder went through the houses of the principal citizens,
      exciting public sentiment against Raimond V., who had so openly braved and
      insulted the privileges of Provençal communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much artifice, much deceit, and a great deal of persistence on the part of
      Master Isnard were necessary to make the inhabitants of La Ciotat share
      his hostility against the lord of Maison-Forte, because the instinct of
      the multitude is always in sympathy with the rebellion of a lord against a
      lord more powerful than himself; but on account of recent disputes about
      fishing privileges, the recorder succeeded in arousing the indignation of
      the multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, it was Sunday morning; after mass the overseers of the
      port held their sessions in the large town hall, situated near the new
      harbour. It was a massive, heavy building, constructed of brick, and had
      many small windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each side rose the dwellings of the wealthiest citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site of the town hall was separated from the port by a narrow little
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noisy crowd of citizens, fishermen, sailors, artisans, and country
      people were pressing into the yard, and many had already seated themselves
      at the door of the town hall, so as to be present at the session of the
      overseers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The citizens, instructed by the recorder, circulated in groups among the
      multitude, and spread the news that Raimond V. despised the rights of the
      people by refusing to appear before the overseers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Talebard-Talebardon, one of the consuls, a large man, corpulent and
      florid, with a shrewd, sly look, wearing his felt hood and official robe,
      occupied with the recorder the centre of one of these animated groups of
      which we have spoken, and which was composed of men of all sorts and
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friends,&rdquo; said the consul, &ldquo;Raimond V. treats Christians as he
      treats the dogs he hunts with. The other day he threatened this
      respectable Master Isnard whom you see here with his whip after having
      exposed him to the fury of two of the fiercest bulls from Camargne; it was
      a miracle that this worthy officer of the admiralty of Toulon escaped the
      awful peril that threatened his life,&rdquo; said the consul, with an important
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A real miracle, for which I return thanks to Our Lady of la Garde,&rdquo; added
      the recorder, devoutly. &ldquo;I never saw such furious bulls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Elmo, my patron!&rdquo; said a sailor, &ldquo;I would gladly have given my new
      scarf to have been a witness of that race. I have never seen bull-fights
      except in Barcelona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without taking into account that recorder-toreadors are very rare,&rdquo; said
      another sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard, deeply wounded at inspiring so little interest, replied,
      with a doleful air, &ldquo;I assure you, my friends, that it is a terrible, a
      formidable thing to be exposed to an attack from these ferocious animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have been pursued by bulls,&rdquo; asked an honest tailor, &ldquo;do tell
      us, M. Recorder, if it is true that angry bulls have the tail curled up,
      and that they shut their eyes when they strike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Talebard-Talebardon shrugged his shoulders, and replied, sternly,
      to the inquirer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think then, cut-cloth, that a person amuses himself by looking at a
      bull&rsquo;s tail and eyes, when he is charging on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, that is true,&rdquo; replied several assistants. &ldquo;Certain it is,&rdquo;
       continued the consul, wishing to move the crowd to pity the recorder, and
      irritate it against the baron, &ldquo;certain it is that this officer of justice
      and of the king narrowly escaped being a victim to the diabolical
      wickedness of Raimond V.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V. destroyed two litters of wolves&rsquo; whelps that ravaged our farm,
      to say nothing of the present he made us of the heads of the wolf and the
      whelps, which are nailed to our door,&rdquo; said a peasant, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V. is not a bad master. If the harvest fails, he comes to your
      aid; he replaced two draught-oxen that I lost through witchcraft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, when one holds out a hand to the lord of Anbiez, he never
      draws it back empty,&rdquo; said an artisan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at the time of the last descent of the pirates in this place, he and
      his people bravely fought the miscreants; but for him, I, my wife, and my
      daughter, would have been carried off by these demons,&rdquo; said a citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the two sons of the good man Jacbuin were redeemed and brought back
      from Barbary by good Father Elzear, the brother of Raimond V. But for him
      they would still have been in chains galling enough to damn their souls,&rdquo;
       replied another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other brother, the commander, who looks as sombre as his black
      galley,&rdquo; said a patron of a merchant vessel, &ldquo;did he not keep those pagans
      in awe for more than two months while his galley lay soaked in the gulf?
      Come, a good and noble family is that of Anbiez. After all, this man of
      law is not one of us,&rdquo; and pointed to the recorder. &ldquo;What does it matter
      to us if he is or is not run through by a bull&rsquo;s horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, that is true; he is not one of us,&rdquo; repeated several
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V. is a good old gentleman who never refuses a pound of powder
      and a pound of lead to a sailor, to defend his boat,&rdquo; said a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always a good place at the fireside of Maison-Forte, a good
      glass of Sauve-chrétien wine and a piece of silver for those who go
      there,&rdquo; said a beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his daughter! An angel! A perfect Notre Dame for the poor people,&rdquo;
       said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who in the devil denies all that?&rdquo; cried the consul. &ldquo;Raimond V.
      kills wolves because he is fond of the chase. He does not mind a piece of
      silver or a pound of powder or a glass of wine, because he is rich, very
      rich; but he does all this to hide his perfidious designs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What designs?&rdquo; asked several auditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The design of ruining our commerce, ravaging our city, in short, doing
      worse than the pirates, or the Duke d&rsquo;Eperaon with his Gascons,&rdquo; said the
      consul, with a mysterious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, which he did not believe, the consul had uttered as an
      experiment, and the alarming disclosure of some hidden design, exciting
      the curiosity of the crowd, was at last listened to with attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain that to us, consul,&rdquo; said all, with one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Isnard, who is a man of the law, is going to explain this tissue
      of dark and pernicious schemes,&rdquo; said Talebard-Talebardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder came forward with an anxious air, raised his eyes to heaven,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your worthy consul, my friends, has told you nothing but what is,
      unfortunately, too true. We have proofs of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proofs!&rdquo; repeated several hearers, looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your attention. The king, our master, and monseigneur the
      cardinal have only one thought,&mdash;the happiness of the French people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are not French, we are quite another thing,&rdquo; said a Provençal,
      proud of his nationality. &ldquo;The king is not our master, he is our count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk finely, my comrade, but listen to me, if you please,&rdquo; replied
      the recorder. &ldquo;The king, our count, not wishing to have his Provençal
      communities exposed to the despotic power of the nobles and lords, has
      ordered us to disarm them. His Eminence remembers too well the violences
      of the Duke d&rsquo;Epernon, of the lords of Baux, of Noirol, of Traviez, and
      many others. He desires now to take away from the nobility the power of
      injuring the people and the peasantry. Thus, for instance, his Eminence
      wished,&mdash;and these sovereign orders will be executed sooner or later,&mdash;he
      wished, I repeat, to remove from Maison-Forte, the castle of Raimond V.,
      the cannon and small pieces of ordnance which guard the entrance of your
      port, and which can prevent the going out of the smallest fishing-boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which can also prevent the entrance of pirates,&rdquo; said a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, my friends, the fire bums or purifies; the arrow kills the
      friend or the enemy, according to the hand which holds the crossbow. I
      should not have had any suspicion of Raimond V., if he had not himself
      unveiled to me his perfidious designs. Let us put aside his cruelty to me.
      I am happy to be the martyr of our sacred cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not a martyr, as you are still living,&rdquo; said the incorrigible
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am living at this moment,&rdquo; replied the recorder, &ldquo;but the Lord knows at
      what price, with what perils, I have bought my life, or what dangers I may
      still be required to meet. But let us not talk of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, do not talk of yourself,&mdash;that does not concern us,&mdash;but
      tell us how you obtained proof of the wicked designs Raimond V. has
      against our city,&rdquo; said an inquirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more evident, my friends. He has fortified his castle again, and
      why? To resist the pirates, say some. But never would the pirates dare
      attack such a fortress, where they would gain nothing but blows. He has
      made a strong fort in his house, from which the cannon can founder your
      vessels and destroy your city. Do you know why? In order to tyrannise over
      you for his profit, and tread Provençal customs under foot with impunity.
      Wait; let me give you an instance. He has, contrary to all law,
      established his fishing-nets outside of his legal boundary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Talebard-Talebardon; &ldquo;you know he has no right to do
      it. What injury that does to our fisheries, often our only resource!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is evident,&rdquo; answered a few hearers; &ldquo;the seines of Raimond V. have
      injured us, especially now when the supply of fish is smaller. But if it
      is his right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not his right!&rdquo; shouted the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will know to-day, as the suit is to be decided by the overseers of the
      port,&rdquo; said an auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder exchanged a glance of intelligence with the consul, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless the tribunal of overseers is all-powerful to decide the
      question, but it is exactly on this point that my doubts have arisen. I
      fear very much that Raimond V. is not willing to refer to this popular
      tribunal. He is capable of refusing to obey that summons, made, after all,
      by poor people, on a high and powerful baron&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible! it is impossible! for it is our special right. The
      people have their rights, the nobility have theirs. Freedom for all!&rdquo;
       cried many voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold Raimond V. to be a good and generous noble,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;but I
      shall regard him as a traitor if he refuses to recognise our privileges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, that is impossible,&rdquo; repeated several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to appear before the overseers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it!&rdquo; said the recorder, exchanging another glance with the
      consul. &ldquo;God grant it, my friends; because, if he despises our customs
      enough to act otherwise, we must think that he put his house in a state of
      such formidable defence only to brave the laws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We repeat that what you are saying, recorder, is impossible. Raimond V.
      cannot deny the authority of the overseers, nor can he deny the authority
      of the king,&rdquo; said an auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, first, he denies the authority of the king,&rdquo; cried Master Isnard,
      triumphantly; &ldquo;and, since I must tell you, I believe, even after what your
      worthy consul has told me, that he will deny, not only the royal power,
      but the rights of the community also; in a word, that he will positively
      refuse to appear before the overseers, and that he wishes to keep his
      seines and nets where they are, to the detriment of the general fishery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hollow murmur of astonishment and indignation welcomed this news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, speak, consul; is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V. is too brave a nobleman for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is true, yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are our rights, after all, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the various remarks which rapidly crossed each other through the
      restless crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul and recorder saw themselves surrounded and pressed by a
      multitude which was becoming angrily impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talebard-Talebardon, in collusion with the recorder, had prepared this
      scene with diabolical cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul replied, hoping to increase the dissatisfaction of the
      populace:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without being absolutely certain of the refusal of Raimond V., I have
      every reason to fear it; but the recorder&rsquo;s clerk, who carried the summons
      to Maison-Forte yesterday, and who has been obliged to go to Curjol on
      business, will arrive in a moment, and confirm the news. Our Lady grant
      that it may not be what I apprehend. Alas! what would become of our
      communities, if our only right, the only privilege accorded to us poor
      people, should be snatched away from us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snatched away!&rdquo; repeated the recorder; &ldquo;it is impossible. The nobility
      and the clergy have their rights. How dare they rob the people of the
      last, the only resource they have against the oppression of the powerful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more easily moved than the mind of the populace, and especially
      of the populace on Mediterranean shores. This crowd, but a moment before
      controlled by their gratitude to the baron, now forgot almost entirely the
      important services rendered to them by the family of Anbiez, at the bare
      suspicion that Raimond V. wished to attack one of the privileges of the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rumours, circulated among different groups, singularly irritated the
      minds of the fishermen. The recorder and the consul, thinking the moment
      had arrived in which they could strike a final blow, ordered one of their
      attendants to go in quest of the recorder&rsquo;s clerk, who ought, they said,
      to have returned from his journey, although, in fact, he had not left La
      Ciotat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the five overseers of the port and their syndic, having
      met after mass under the porch of the church, passed through the crowd to
      enter the town hall, where they were to hold their solemn audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new circumstances gave additional interest to their appearance; they
      were saluted on all sides with numerous bravos, accompanied with the
      cries:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the overseers of the port!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the Provençal communities!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with those who attack them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd, now greatly excited, pressed hard upon the steps of the
      overseers, so as to be present at the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the clerk arrived. Although he said much in protest of the
      interpretation given to his words by the recorder and the consul, those
      men continued to exclaim with hypocritical lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, ah, well, consul,&rdquo; cried one of the crowd, &ldquo;is Raimond V.
      coming? Will he appear before the tribunal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my friends,&rdquo; replied the consul, &ldquo;do not question me. The worthy
      recorder has predicted only too well. The tyrannical, imperious, irascible
      character of the baron has been again made manifest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clerk was charged yesterday to notify Raimond V. to appear before the
      tribunal of overseers; he has returned and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is! Ah,&mdash;well, come to the point!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, he has been overwhelmed with the cruel treatment of Raimond V.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; whispered the clerk, &ldquo;on the contrary, the baron made me drink so
      much wine that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard seized the clerk so violently by his smock-frock, and threw
      such a furious glance on him, that the poor man did not dare utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After having overwhelmed him with cruel treatment,&rdquo; continued the consul,
      &ldquo;Raimond formally declared to him that he would make straw of our
      privileges, that he intended to keep his seines, and that he was strong
      enough to overcome us, if we dared act contrary to his will, and that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An explosion of fury interrupted the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult was at its height; the most violent threats burst out against
      Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the fishing-nets! the fishing-nets!&rdquo; cried some.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Maison-Forte!&rdquo; cried others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not leave one stone upon another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arms! to arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us make a petard to blow up the gate of the moat on the land side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death, death to Raimond V.!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the fury of the populace, the recorder and the consul began to fear
      that they had gone too far, and that they would find it impossible to
      control the passions they had so imprudently unchained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&mdash;my children!&rdquo; cried Talebard-Tale-bardon, addressing
      the most excited of the speakers, &ldquo;be moderate. Run to the fishing-nets,&mdash;that
      you may do, but make no attack upon Maison-Forte, or upon the life of the
      baron!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No pity!&mdash;no pity! You yourself have told us, consul, that Raimond
      was going to fire on the city and the port and do worse than the Duke
      d&rsquo;Epernon and his Gascons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Let us destroy the old wolfs den and nail him to his door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Maison-Forte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Maison-Forte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the furious cries which met the tardy words of moderation, which
      the consul now tried to make the excited people heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more peaceable inhabitants pressed around the town hall, so as to
      enter the room of the tribunal where the overseers were already seated.
      Others, divided into two bands, were preparing, in spite of the entreaties
      of the consul, to destroy the fishing-nets and attack Maison-Forte des
      Anbiez, when an extraordinary incident struck the crowd with amazement,
      and rendered it silent and motionless.

      CHAPTER XVII. THE JUDGMENT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The general astonishment was very natural.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Slowly descending the street, in the direction of the public square, was
      seen the heavy ceremonial carriage of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four of his men, armed and on horseback, preceded by Laramée, opened the
      march; then came the carriage, with a crimson velvet canopy, somewhat
      worn; the retinue, as well as the body of the carriage, which was without
      windows, yet bore conspicuously the baron&rsquo;s coat of arms, showed the red
      and yellow colours of the livery of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four strong draught-horses, yoked with rope traces, laboriously dragged
      this rude and massive vehicle, in the depth of which sat the baron
      majestically enthroned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite him sat Honorât de Berrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the coach, near the doors, two small stools were placed. On one sat
      Abbé Mascarolus, with a bag of papers on his knees. The steward of the
      baron occupied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imperfect construction of this ponderous vehicle permitted no place
      for a coachman. A carter, dressed for the occasion in a greatcoat, with
      the baron&rsquo;s livery, walked at the head of each pair of horses, and
      conducted the equipage as he would have managed a farm-wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, behind the carriage came four other armed men on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although rude, this equipage and retinue inspired profound admiration
      among the inhabitants of the little town; the sight of a coach, however
      inelegant, was always to them a novel and interesting thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, the crowd stood silently looking on. They knew that
      Raimond V. never used this carriage except on important occasions, and a
      lively curiosity suspended for a time their most violent passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They whispered among each other concerning the direction the carriage
      would take: was it to the church, or was it to the town hall?
    </p>
    <p>
      This last supposition became probable as Raimond V., having turned the
      corner of the street, took the road which led to the edifice where the
      overseers of the port were assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon doubt changed to certainty, when they heard the stentorian voice of
      Laramée cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Room! make way for monseigneur, who is going to the tribunal of the
      overseers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theae words, passing from mouth to mouth, finally reached the ears of the
      consul and the recorder, whose disappointment and vexation were extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what have you said, recorder?&rdquo; cried the men who surrounded him,
      &ldquo;here is Raimond V.; he is coming to present himself before the tribunal
      of overseers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he has not resolved to make straw of our privileges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He intends to appear, yes, he intends to appear without doubt,&rdquo; said
      Master Isnard, &ldquo;but he is coming with a retinue of armed men; who can tell
      what he is going to say to those poor overseers of the port?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless he wishes to intimidate them,&rdquo; said the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wishes to make his refusal to recognise their jurisdiction all the
      more contemptuous by coming to tell them so himself,&rdquo; said the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An armed retinue?&rdquo; said a hearer. &ldquo;And what do these men with carbines
      intend to do against us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The consul is right. He is coming to insult the overseers,&rdquo; said one of
      the most defiant citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, Raimond V., as bold as he is, would never dare do that,&rdquo; 
      replied a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; he recognises our privileges,&mdash;he is a good and worthy
      lord,&rdquo; cried several voices. &ldquo;We were wrong to distrust him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a word, by one of those sudden changes so common in popular
      excitements, the mind of the people at once turned over to the favour of
      Raimond V. and to hostility toward the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Isnard put both his responsibility and his person under cover, and,
      in so doing, did not hesitate to expose his unfortunate clerk to the anger
      of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of manifesting hostility to the baron, several of the citizens now
      assumed a threatening attitude toward the recorder for having deceived
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this stranger,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;who has excited us against Raimond V.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This good and worthy noble who has always stood for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, that is so; he told us that Raimond wished to destroy our
      privileges, and, on the contrary, he respects them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, monseigneur did well in delivering him to the bulls of
      Camargne,&rdquo; cried a sailor, shaking his fist at the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, my friends,&rdquo; said the recorder, painfully realising the
      absence of the consul, who had prudently escaped to the town hall, where
      he would appear as a plaintiff against the baron, &ldquo;permit me to say that,
      although nothing could make me put faith in the baron&rsquo;s good intentions, I
      do not hesitate to say that good may come out of all this. Perhaps my
      clerk has been mistaken; perhaps he has exaggerated the extent of the
      remarks made by the Baron des Anbiez. Come now, clerk,&rdquo; said he, turning
      to the scribe with a severe and haughty air, &ldquo;do not lie. Have you not
      deceived me? Recall your experience. Perhaps you were frightened into
      wrong. I know you are a coward. What did the baron say to you? Zounds!
      clerk, woe to you if you have deceived me, and if by your folly I, myself,
      have deceived these estimable citizens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Opening his large eyes to their utmost, and utterly confounded by the
      audacity of the recorder, the poor clerk could only repeat, in a trembling
      voice: &ldquo;Monseigneur told me nothing; he made me sit down at his table, and
      every time I tried to tell him of the summons from the overseers Master
      Laramée came with a big glass of Spanish wine, that I was, to speak
      reverently, obliged to swallow at one draught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; cried the recorder, in a thundering voice. &ldquo;What! this is the
      bad treatment you complained of! Forgive him, gentlemen, he was certainly
      drunk, and I am sorry to see that he has deceived us about the designs of
      Raimond V. Let us hasten to the town hall, where we can assure ourselves
      of the reality of certain facts, for the baron&rsquo;s carriage has stopped
      there, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, and without appearing to hear the threatening murmurs of
      the crowd, the recorder hurried away, accompanied by the unfortunate
      clerk, who in the retreat received several thrusts, evidently addressed to
      Master Isnard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large audience-chamber of the town hall in La Ciotat formed a long
      parallelogram lighted by tall, narrow windows, with panes set in frames of
      lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the walls opposite the windows&mdash;bare walls, white with a coating
      of lime&mdash;were displayed several flags captured from Barbary pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projecting rafters of unpolished wood crossed each other beneath the
      ceiling. At the extremity of this immense hall and opposite the large door
      of entrance could be seen, upon a stage, the tribunal of the overseers of
      the port. Before them was a long table roughly cut at right angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judges were four in number, presided over by the watchman from the
      cape of l&rsquo;Aigle, who had temporarily resigned his ordinary functions into
      the hands of Luquin Trinquetaille.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to custom, these fishermen wore black breeches, a black doublet,
      and a black mantle, with a white band; on their heads they wore hats with
      a wide brim. The youngest of these judges was not less than fifty years
      old. Their attitude was simple and serious; their sunburnt faces and long
      white or gray hair shone with a Rembrandt light under the sudden ray of
      sunshine shooting from the narrow windows, and were distinctly outlined on
      the shadowy light which reigned in the body of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      These five old seamen, elected by their corporation on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day,
      justified the choice of their companions. Brave, honest, and pious, they
      assuredly represented the best of the maritime population of the town and
      the gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribunal and the place reserved for those who were to appear before
      them were separated from the crowd by a rude barrier of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We quote from the work, &ldquo;Voyage and Inspection of M. de Séguiran,&rdquo; already
      cited in the preface: &ldquo;The jurisdiction of the overseers was very simple.
      Whoso wishes to enter a complaint before these overseers can be heard, but
      not before he has deposited two sous and eight farthings in the common
      purse, after which he can demand the party against whom he enters a
      complaint. The said party is obliged to make the same deposit, and both
      are heard; and at the end of the argument the eldest of these overseers
      pronounces judgment according to the counsel of his colleagues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary of the community called in a loud voice the plaintiffs and
      defendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had a session excited so much interest in the public mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the arrival of Raimond V. the greater part of those who filled the
      hall were still ignorant of the baron&rsquo;s intentions, whether or not he
      would appear before the tribunal. The smaller number, however, hoped that
      he would respect the privileges of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they learned from the curious ones outside that the gentleman&rsquo;s
      carriage of state was already in the square, they eagerly watched every
      movement of the constantly increasing multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crier was obliged to elevate his voice to its utmost to command
      silence, and Peyrou, the watchman, as assignee of the overseers, at last
      administered a severe rebuke to the clamorous crowd, and order finally
      prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribunal then regulated some business of little importance, but with
      as much care and deliberate circumspection, and as much attention to
      detail, as if one of the first lords of Provence was not expected every
      moment to appear before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The multitude was compact when Raimond V. presented himself at the door,
      and he had great difficulty in entering the large hall with Honorât de
      Berrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make way, make way for monseigneur!&rdquo; cried several eager voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the overseers called me, my children?&rdquo; said Raimond V.,
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will wait here with you. It will be time to make way for me when I
      am called before the tribunal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These simple words, uttered with as much kindness as dignity, had a
      tremendous effect upon the crowd. The veneration inspired by the old
      gentleman, who but a moment before had been so menaced, was so great that
      the people formed a sort of circle of solemnity around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer took great pains to inform the secretary that the baron had
      entered the hall, and that it would be proper to call his case before
      others on the docket. The secretary, profiting from a short interval,
      submitted this suggestion to Peyrou, the assignee or syndic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter simply replied: &ldquo;Secretary, what is the next name on your
      list?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques Brun, pilot, versus Pierre Baif, sailmaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then call Jacques Brun and Pierre Baif.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou owed much to the baron&rsquo;s family. He was warmly attached to the
      house of Anbiez. In thus acting, he did not wish to make a display of his
      rights and exaggerate their importance. He was only obeying the spirit of
      justice and independence found in popular institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was without hesitation, and without the least intention to offend
      Raimond V., that the watchman said, in a loud and firm voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secretary, call another plaintiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dispute between Jacques Brun, the pilot, and the sailmaker, Pierre
      Baif, was of little importance. It was promptly, but carefully, decided by
      the overseers in the midst of the general preoccupation, and the cause of
      the baron immediately followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the presence of the Baron des Anbiez, it was not known
      that he intended to appear before the tribunal. Naturally, the crowd
      remembered the insinuations of Master Isnard. The latter insisted that the
      baron was capable of manifesting his contempt for the tribunal in a very
      startling manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the secretary called, in an excited voice: &ldquo;Master
      Talebard-Talebardon, consul of the city of La Ciotat, versus Raimond V.,
      Baron des Anbiez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long murmur of satisfied impatience circulated around the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my children,&rdquo; said the old gentlemen to those who surrounded him,
      &ldquo;make way, I pray you, not for the baron, but for the suitor who is going
      before his judges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiasm inspired by these words of Raimond V. proved that, in spite
      of their instinctive thirst for equality, the people always had an immense
      liking for persons of rank who submitted to the common law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd, dividing on each side, made a wide avenue, in the middle of
      which Raimond V. walked with a grave and majestic step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman wore the sumptuous costume of the time: a doublet with
      points, a short mantle of brown velvet, richly braided with gold, wide
      trousers of the same material, which formed a sort of skirt descending
      below the knee. His scarlet silk stockings disappeared in the funnel of
      his short boots made of cordovan leather, and equipped with long gold
      spurs. A costly shoulder-belt sustained his sword, and the white plumes of
      his black cap fell over his collar of Flanders lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of the old gentleman, habitually joyous, showed at that
      moment a lofty expression of nobility and authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few steps from the tribunal the baron took off his hat, which he had
      kept on until then, although the crowd was uncovered. One could not help
      admiring the dignity of the face and bearing of this noble old man with
      long hair and gray moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Master Talebardon arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his usual assurance, and although he had the recorder
      Isnard at his heels, he could not conquer his emotion, and carefully
      avoided the baron&rsquo;s glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou rose, as well as the other overseers; he kept his hat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Talebard-Talebardon, come forward,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul entered the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, come forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron entered the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard Talebard-Talebardon, you demand, in the name of the community of
      La Ciotat, to be heard by the overseers of the port, against Raimond V.,
      Baron des Anbiez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, syndic,&rdquo; replied the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deposit two sous and eight farthings in the common purse, and speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consul put the money in a wooden box, and, advancing near the
      tribunal, stated his grievance in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syndic and overseers, from time immemorial the fishery of the cove of
      Camerou has been divided between the community of the city and the lord of
      Anbiez; the said lord can lay his nets and seines from the coast to the
      rocks called the Seven Stones of Castrembaou, which form a sort of belt,
      about five hundred steps from the coast. The community hold the right from
      the Seven Stones of Castrembaou to the two points of the bay; before you,
      syndic and overseers, I affirm on oath that this is the truth, and I
      adjure Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, here present and called by me, to say
      if such is not the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the gentleman, Peyrou said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, is what the plaintiff says true? Has the
      right of fishery always been thus divided between the lords of Anbiez and
      the community of the city of La Ciotat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fishery has always been thus divided. I recognise it,&rdquo; said the
      baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect agreeableness with which the baron made his reply left no
      doubt as to his submission to the ability of the tribunal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of satisfaction circulated through the hall. &ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; said
      Peyrou to the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syndic and overseers,&rdquo; pursued Talebard-Talebardon, &ldquo;in spite of our
      rights and our custom, instead of confining himself to the space between
      the rocks of the Seven Stones of Castrembaou and the coast, Raimond V.,
      Baron des Anbiez, has laid his nets beyond the rocks of the Seven Stones
      toward the high sea, and consequently has injured the rights of the
      community which I represent. He fishes in the part reserved for the said
      community. These facts, which I affirm on oath, are known, besides, to
      everybody, as well as yourselves, syndic and overseers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The syndic and the overseers are not in this suit,&rdquo; replied the watchman
      to the consul, severely. Then turning to the gentleman, he said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, do you admit that you have thrown your nets
      on this side of the Seven Rocks, and toward the high sea, in the part of
      the cove reserved for the community of La Ciotat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had my nets thrown this side of the Seven Rocks,&rdquo; said the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plaintiff, what do you demand from Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez?&rdquo; said
      the syndic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require,&rdquo; answered Talebard-Talebardon, &ldquo;the tribunal to forbid the
      lord of Anbiez henceforth to fish or to lay seines beyond the rocks of
      Castrembaou; I require that the said lord be commanded to pay to the said
      community, under the claim of damages and restitution, the sum of two
      thousand pounds; I require that the said lord be notified that, if he
      again lay nets and seines in that part of the cove which does not belong
      to him, the said community shall have the right to remove and destroy by
      force the said nets and seines, making the lord of Anbiez alone
      responsible for the disorders which may follow the exercise of this
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they heard the consul formulate so clearly his charge against Raimond
      V., the spectators turned to look at the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained calm and unmoved, to the great astonishment of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violent and impetuous character of the baron was so well known that
      his calmness and self-possession inspired as much admiration as
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou, addressing the old lord, said, in a solemn tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, what have you to reply to the plaintiff? Do
      you accept his requisitions from you as just and fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syndic and overseers,&rdquo; replied the baron, bowing respectfully, &ldquo;yes, that
      is true. I have had my nets laid outside of the Seven Rocks of
      Oastrembaou, but, in order to explain my act, I will state that which all
      of you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, we are not in this suit,&rdquo; said Peyrou,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his self-control and his affection for the watchman, the old
      gentleman bit his lip, but soon regained his calmness and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say to you, syndic and overseers, what every one knows: for
      several years the sea has fallen to such a degree that the part of the
      cove in which I had the right to fish has become dry. The sea broom has
      pushed its way there to the utmost, and my greyhound Eclair started a hare
      there the other day; honestly, syndic and overseers, to make any use of
      the part of the cove which belongs to me, I should need, now, horses and
      guns, instead of boats and nets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron&rsquo;s reply, delivered with his usual good humour, amused the crowd;
      even the overseers could not repress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The retreat of the sea has been so great that there is hardly six feet of
      water in the spot around the Seven Rocks, where my fishing-place ends and
      that of the community begins. I have believed I had the right to lay my
      nets and my seines five hundred steps beyond the Seven Rocks, since there
      was no more water on this side, supposing that the community, following my
      example, and the movement of the water, would also advance five hundred
      steps toward the high sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moderation manifest in the baron&rsquo;s tone, his reasons, which were
      really plausible, made a very great impression on the spectators, although
      the greater part of them had a common cause with the consul, who
      represented the interest of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing the consul, the syndic said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talebard-Talebardon, what have you to reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syndic and overseers, I reply that the cove of Castrembaou has no more
      than six hundred steps to begin from the Seven Rocks, and that if the lord
      of Anbiez is adjudged five hundred, there will hardly remain one hundred
      steps for the community to throw its nets; now, every one knows that
      fishing for tunnies is profitable only in the bay. No doubt the waters,
      retiring, have left all the fishing domain of the lord of Anbiez dry, but
      that is not the fault of the community, and the community ought not to
      suffer from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long time this grave question was in litigation. As we have said,
      the rights and opinions were so divided, that the consuls could have
      arranged everything amicably for the baron, but for the perfidious counsel
      of Master Isnard, the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honest seamen, who composed the tribunal, almost invariably showed
      excellent sense; their judgments, based on the practice of an avocation
      which they had followed from infancy, were simple and righteous.
      Nevertheless, on this occasion, they were not a little embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to answer, Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez?&rdquo; said Peyrou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only to answer, overseers and syndic, that neither is it my fault
      that the waters have retired; by my title I possess the right of fishing
      over half the bay; owing to the retreat of the waters, I can go dry-shod
      over my piscatorial domain, as my chaplain says; now I ought not, I think,
      to be the victim of a circumstance which is the result of a superior
      force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V.,&rdquo; said one of the overseers, an old tar with white hair, &ldquo;do
      you hold, by your title, the right to fish from the coast to the Seven
      Rocks, or the right to fish over an extent of five hundred steps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My title claims the right to fish from the coast to the Seven Rocks,&rdquo;
       replied the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old seaman whispered a few words to his neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou rose, and said, &ldquo;We have heard enough, we will proceed to give
      judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syndic and overseers,&rdquo; replied the baron, &ldquo;whatever may be your decision,
      I submit to it beforehand.&rdquo; Peyrou then said, in a loud voice:
      &ldquo;Talebard-Talebardon, Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez, your cause is heard.
      We, overseers and syndic, will now consider it.&rdquo; The five fishermen rose,
      and retired into the embrasure of a window. They seemed to be arguing very
      animatedly, while the crowd awaited their decision in profound and
      respectful silence; the lord of Anbiez talked in a low voice with Honorât
      de Berrol, who was much impressed by the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about a half-hour&rsquo;s discussion, the syndic and overseers resumed
      their places, and stood with their hats on, while Peyrou read from a large
      book of registration the following formal statement, which always preceded
      the decree of this tribunal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This day, 20th day of December, in the year 1632, being assembled in the
      town hall of La Ciotat, we, syndic and overseers of the port, having made
      Talebard-Tale-bardon, consul of the city, and Raimond V., Baron des
      Anbiez, appear before us, and having heard the aforesaid in their
      accusation and defence, aver what follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The demand of Talebard-Talebardon seems to us a just one. According to
      the title of Raimond V., his right of fishery does not extend
      indifferently over a space of five hundred steps, but over the space lying
      between the coast and the Seven Rocks of Castrembaou. The waters have
      retired from the part which belonged to him; that is the will of the
      Almighty, and Raimond must submit to it. If, as in the Gulf of Martignes,
      the sea had advanced on the coast, the fishery of Raimond V. would have
      been so much increased, and the community could not have exceeded their
      limits beyond the Seven Rocks; the opposite has taken place, which, no
      doubt, is unfortunate for the lord of Anbiez, but the community cannot
      surrender its rights of fishery. God controls the waters as pleases him,
      and we must accept what he sends. Our conscience and our reason then
      decide that henceforth Raimond V. can lay no more nets or seines outside
      of the Seven Rocks; but we also decide, in order to prove the gratitude of
      this city to the said Raimond V., who has always been her good and
      courageous protector, that he has the right to ten pounds of fish for
      every hundred pounds of fish which are caught in the bay. We know the good
      faith of our brother fishermen, and are sure that they will honestly
      fulfil this condition. The provost and other officers of the city are
      hereby notified to execute our judgment pronounced against Raimond V.,
      Baron des Anbiez. In case the said lord of Anbiez opposes our judgment, he
      will be required to pay one hundred pounds forfeit, of which one-third
      goes to the king, one-third to the hospital of St. Esprit, and the other
      third to the said community. The hearing of the said misdemeanours and
      disputes of fishery being by the letters patent of Henry II. prohibited to
      Parliament and all other magistrates, their Majesty decreeing that suits
      brought before them on the question of the fishery shall be referred to
      the said overseers to be heard and judged by them, in consequence of which
      the decisions of the said overseers have always been declared without
      appeal. Made in town hall of La Ciotat, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reason and good sense of this decision were wonderfully appreciated by
      the crowd; they applauded the judgment repeatedly, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the overseers! Long live Raimond V.!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The session being ended, the crowd dispersed. Raimond V. remained a few
      minutes in the hall, and said to the watchman of the cape of l&rsquo;Aigle, as
      he grasped him by the hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Righteously judged, my old Peyrou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, poor people like us are neither lawyers nor scribes, but the
      Lord inspires the honest with a sense of justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest man,&rdquo; said the baron, looking at him with keen interest, &ldquo;will you
      dine with me at Maison-Forte?&rdquo; &ldquo;My sentry-box is waiting for me,
      monseigneur, and Luquin Trinquetaille is getting weary of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, then, I will see you at Maison-Forte with my brothers; they
      will arrive soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any news from the commander?&rdquo; asked Peyrou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some from Malta; it was good, and informs me again of his return
      here for Christmas, but his letter is sadder than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The watchman looked down and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Peyrou,&rdquo; said the baron, &ldquo;how grievous is this melancholy, whose
      cause I do not know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very distressing,&rdquo; replied the watchman, absorbed in his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, at least, know the cause of it,&rdquo; said the baron, with a sort of
      bitterness, as if he had suffered from his brother&rsquo;s reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; said Peyrou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up! I do not ask you to unveil this sad secret to me, since it is
      not your own. Come, good-bye, my honest fellow. After all, I am very glad
      that our dispute was judged by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Peyrou, who seemed to wish to escape from the
      recollections awakened by the baron&rsquo;s questions about the commander, &ldquo;it
      was rumoured that you would not come before the tribunal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at first I resolved not to go there. Talebard-Talebardon could have
      come to an amicable settlement; in the first moment of anger I thought of
      sending all of you to the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, it was not the consul only who decided to bring the case
      before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so, and for that reason I reconsidered it; instead of acting
      like a fool, I have acted with the wisdom of a graybeard. It was that
      scoundrel from the admiralty of Toulon that I whipped, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say so, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, Honorât,&rdquo; said the baron, turning around to M. de Berrol.
      &ldquo;Come, we shall see you soon, Peyrou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon going out of the large hall, the baron saw his carriage, which was
      drawn up in the town hall square, surrounded by the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saluted him with acclamation and he was deeply moved by this
      reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to enter the carriage he saw Master Isnard, the
      recorder, standing within the embrasure of a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of law seemed quite melancholy over the result of the session. His
      perfidious designs had miscarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! Master Recorder,&rdquo; cried the baron, half-way up his carriage steps,
      &ldquo;do you return soon to Marseilles?&rdquo; &ldquo;I return there immediately,&rdquo; answered
      he, peevishly. &ldquo;Ah, well, just say to the Marshal of Vitry that, if I
      threatened you with my whip it was because you brought from him insulting
      orders to the Provençal nobility; you see that I am quite willing to
      appear before the popular tribunal whose decisions I respect. As to the
      difference of my conduct under the two circumstances, you, recorder, can
      explain it to the marshal. I shall always resist by force the iniquitous
      orders of tyrants, sent by a tyrant cardinal, but I shall always respect
      the rights and privileges of the ancient Provençal communities. The
      nobility is to the people what the blade is to the hilt. The communities
      are to us what we are to them; do you understand, you rascal? Tell that to
      your Vitry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monseigneur, these words&mdash;&rdquo; said the recorder, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Raimond V., interrupting him, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him, in short, that if I keep my house fortified, it is that I may
      be useful to the city, as I have been. When the shepherd has no dogs, the
      flock is soon devoured; and, Manjour, the wolves are not far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered these words, Raimond V. entered his carriage and slowly
      departed, followed by the prolonged shouts and acclamations of the
      multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, notwithstanding his candour and bluntness of speech,
      had, with great deftness and a shrewd policy, ranged the populace on his
      side in the event of a possible collision with the power of the marshal.

      CHAPTER XVIII. the telescope.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the session, during which, in his function of syndic of the
      overseers of the port, he had declared the condemnation of Raimond V., the
      watchman of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle returned to his sentry-box, temporarily entrusted
      to the care of the brave Luquin Trinquetaille.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou was sad; the last words of the Baron des Anbiez on the subject of
      the commander had awakened the most painful memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he ascended the steep fortifications of the promontory, his heart
      expanded. Too much accustomed to solitude to find enjoyment in the society
      of men, the watchman was happy only when he was on the summit of his rock,
      where he listened in sweet meditation to the distant roaring of the sea
      and the terrible bursts of the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more absolute, nothing is more imperious, than the habit of
      isolation, especially among those who find inexhaustible resources in
      their own power of observation or in the varied extravagance of their own
      imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a profound feeling of satisfaction that the watchman set foot
      upon the esplanade of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached his sentry-box, and there found the worthy Luquin fast
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou&rsquo;s first act was to scan the horizon with an anxious look, then to
      examine it with the aid of his telescope. Happily, he saw nothing
      suspicious, and his countenance took on rather a cheerful than a severe
      expression, when, roughly shaking the captain of <i>The Holy Terror to the
      Moors</i>, he called to him, in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up, wake up! the pirates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin made a bound and stood on his feet, rubbing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, my boy,&rdquo; said the watchman, &ldquo;so your great activity has fallen
      asleep. To hear you talk, one would think a doree or a mullet could not
      have made a leap in the sea without you knowing it. Ah, young man, young
      man, the old Provençal proverb, <i>Proun paillou, prou gran</i>,&mdash;Much
      straw, little grain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin looked at the watchman with a bewildered expression, and was hardly
      able to collect his faculties; finally, reeling like a drunken man, he
      said, stretching his arms: &ldquo;It is true, Master Peyrou, I slept like a
      cabin-boy on the watch, but I did keep my eyes open with all my strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the reason, my boy, sleep got into them so easily. But I am here
      now, and you can go down into the city. There will be more than one bottle
      of wine emptied without your help at the tavern of the Golden Anchor.&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      Luquin had not entirely come to himself, and he stood staring at the
      watchman with a stupid air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou, no doubt, trying to wake the captain entirely from his condition
      of torpor, added: &ldquo;Come, come now, Stephanette, your betrothed, will be
      engaged to dance with Terzarol, the pilot, or with the patron Bernard, and
      you will not have her hand once the whole day long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words produced a magic effect on the captain; he straightened
      himself on his long legs, shook himself, tried to keep his equilibrium,
      and, finally stamping on the ground several times, said to the watchman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Master Peyrou, if I were not sure of having swallowed only one
      glass of sauve-chrétien with that devil of a Bohemian, to make peace with
      him, because Stephanette wanted me to do it,&mdash;a base weakness for
      which I cannot forgive myself,&mdash;I should certainly think I was
      drunk,&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange, you drank only one glass of sauve-chrétien with the
      Bohemian, and you are overcome by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one glass, and that only half full, because what you drink with a
      miscreant like him tastes very bitter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this Bohemian always at
      Maison-Forte, pray?&rdquo; asked Peyrou, with a thoughtful and serious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always, Master Peyrou, for everybody there dotes on him, from monseigneur
      to Abbé Mascarolus. He is in high favour with the women, from Mlle. Reine
      to old Dulceline, without speaking of Stephanette, who gave him a
      flame-coloured ribbon&mdash;flame-coloured ribbons, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Luquin, with indignation. &ldquo;It is a ribbon woven by the rope-maker that
      this wretch needs! But what can you do? All the women have their heads
      turned. And why? Because this vagabond strums, good and bad together, in
      some sort of fashion, an old guitar, so hoarse that it sounds like the
      pulleys of my tartan, when they hoist the big sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not the Bohemian arrive at Maison-Forte the day Raimond V. had the
      recorder chased by a bull?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Master Peyrou, it was on that fatal day
      that this stray dog set foot in Maison-Forte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange!&rdquo; said the watchman, talking to himself. &ldquo;Then I was
      mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Master Peyrou, I am often seized with a desire to conduct this
      vagabond out to the cove beach, and exchange pistol-shots with him until
      either he or I come to our death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Luquin, you are foolish, jealousy makes you wild, and you are
      wrong. Stephanette is a good and honest girl, I can tell you. As to this
      vagabond&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then interrupting himself, as if he wished to keep what he was about to
      say secret from Luquin, he added: &ldquo;Come, come, my boy, do not lose your
      time with a poor old man, while your young and pretty betrothed is waiting
      for you. Do not neglect her; be with her often, and marry her as soon as
      possible. There is another Provençal proverb: <i>A boueno taire bouen
      labourraire</i>,&mdash;A good labourer for good soil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Master Peyrou, you put balm in my blood,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You
      are almost as good as a sorcerer. Everybody respects you and loves you;
      you take Stephanette&rsquo;s part, so she must deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Our Lady, she deserves it without a doubt. Did she not come before
      your departure for Nice, and ask me if you could undertake the voyage with
      safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Master Peyrou, and thanks to you and your cabalistic papers
      that I put on my bullets, and to your oil of Syrakoe, not less magical,
      with which I rubbed my muskets and cannon, I gave a hot chase to a corsair
      that came near, indiscreetly near, the Terror to the Moors and the vessels
      she was escorting. Ah, you are a great man, Master Peyrou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those who heed my counsels are wise and sensible,&rdquo; replied the
      watchman, smiling. &ldquo;Now the wise never allow their betrothed to grow weary
      of waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After having thanked the watchman again, Luquin Trinquetaille decided to
      profit by the advice given with regard to Stephanette, and went in all
      haste to Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding himself alone, Peyrou breathed a sigh of content, as if he felt
      again that he was master of his little kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he received those who came to consult him with kindly courtesy,
      he saw them depart with a secret pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered his little cell and sighed deeply after having contemplated for
      some time the costly piece of ebony furniture which always seemed to
      awaken painful memories in his mind; then, as night came on, he wrapped
      himself in his thick hood and coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus well protected from the north wind which was blowing, Peyrou lit his
      pipe, and surveyed with sadness the immense horizon which was spread out
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, the house of Maison-Forte could be distinctly seen from
      the western side of the summit of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about three o&rsquo;clock, and the watchman thought he saw a ship in the
      distance. He took up his telescope, and for a long time followed the
      uncertain point with his eyes, until it became more and more distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon recognised a heavy merchant vessel whose aspect presented nothing
      of menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the manoeuvres and progress of this vessel with the aid of his
      telescope, he unconsciously turned it upon the imposing mass of
      Maison-Forte, the home of Raimond V., and on one part of the beach which
      was absolutely bare, at the point where it touched the rocks upon which
      the castle stood. He soon distinguished Reine des Anbiez mounted on her
      nag and followed by Master Laramée. The young girl was going, doubtless,
      in advance of the baron into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several huge rocks intervened, cutting off the view from the beach, and
      Peyrou lost sight of Mlle. Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment the watchman was startled by a loud noise; he felt the
      air above him in commotion, and suddenly his eagle fell at his feet. She
      had come, no doubt, to demand her accustomed food, as her hoarse and
      impatient cries testified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman sat caressing the bird abstractedly, when a new incident
      awakened his interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sight was so penetrating that, in watching the spot on the coast where
      Mlle, des Anbiez would be likely to appear, he distinguished a man who
      seemed to be cautiously hiding himself in the hollow of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning his telescope at once on this man, he recognised the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great astonishment, he saw him draw from a bag a white pigeon, and
      attach to its neck a small sack, into which he slipped a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the Bohemian thought himself protected from all observation, as,
      owing to the form and elevation of the rock where he was squatting, it was
      impossible for him to be seen either from the coast or from Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only from the prodigious height of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle, which commanded the
      entire shore of the bay, could Master Peyrou have discovered the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having looked anxiously from one side to the other, as if he feared
      he might be seen in spite of his precautions, the vagabond again secured
      the little sack around the neck of the pigeon, and then let it fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the intelligent bird knew the direction it was to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once set at liberty, it did not hesitate, but rose almost perpendicularly
      above the Bohemian, then flew rapidly toward the east. As quick as
      thought, Peyrou took his eagle and tried to make her perceive the pigeon,
      which already appeared no larger than a white speck in space.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few seconds the eagle did not seem to see the bird; then, suddenly
      uttering a hoarse cry, she violently spread her broad wings, and started
      in pursuit of the Bohemian&rsquo;s emissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either the unfortunate pigeon was warned by the instinct of danger which
      threatened it, or it heard the discordant cries of its enemy, for it
      redoubled its swiftness, and flew with the rapidity of an arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it endeavoured to rise above the eagle, hoping perhaps to escape its
      pursuer by disappearing in the low, dark clouds which veiled the horizon;
      but the eagle, with one swoop of her powerful wings, mounted to such a
      height, that the pigeon, unable to cope with its adversary, rapidly fell
      within a few feet of the surface of the sea, grazing the top of the
      highest waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brilliant still followed her victim in this new manoeuvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman was divided between the desire to see the end of the struggle
      between the eagle and the pigeon, and the curiosity to watch the
      countenance of the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to his telescope, he saw the Bohemian in a state of extraordinary
      excitement as he followed with intense anxiety the diverse chances of
      destruction or safety left to his messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the pigeon attempted one last effort; realising, no doubt, that
      its destination was too far to be reached, it tried to return and come
      back to the coast, and thus escape its terrible enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, its strength failed; its flight became heavy, and,
      approaching too near the waves, it was swept by foam and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eagle availed herself of the moment when the pigeon was painfully
      resuming its embarrassed flight to fall upon it with the rapidity of a
      thunderbolt. She seized the pigeon in her strong claws, rose swiftly in
      the direction of the promontory, and came with her prey to take refuge in
      her eyrie, on a rock not far from the watchman&rsquo;s sentry-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou rose quickly to take the pigeon from her; he could not succeed. The
      natural ferocity of Brilliant was in the ascendency; she bristled her
      feathers, uttered sharp and fierce cries, and showed herself disposed to
      defend her prey with her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou feared to offend her, lest she might fly away and hide in some
      inaccessible rock; he allowed her to devour the pigeon in peace, having
      observed that the little sack tied around the neck of the bird consisted
      of two silver plates fastened by a small chain of the same material.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not, after that discovery, fear the destruction of the letter which
      he knew was enclosed therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the eagle was devouring the Bohemian&rsquo;s messenger in peace, Peyrou
      returned to the door of his cell, took up his telescope, and vainly
      examined the rocks on the coast, in order to discover the Bohemian; he had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was occupied with this new investigation, the watchman saw on the
      shore the carriage of Raimond V. The baron had mounted Laramée&rsquo;s horse,
      and was riding by the side of Reine, and doubtless accompanied her to
      Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking the eagle had finished her feast, the watchman directed his steps
      to her eyrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brilliant was no longer there, but among the bones and feathers of the
      pigeon he saw the little sack, opened it, and found there a letter of a
      few lines written in Arabic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Peyrou was not acquainted with that language. Only, in his
      frequent campaigns against the Barbary pirates, he had noticed in the
      letters of marque of the corsairs the word Reis, which means captain, and
      which always followed the name of the commander of the vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the letter which he had just captured, he found the word Reis three
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought the Bohemian was possibly the secret emissary of some Barbary
      pirate, whose ship, ambuscaded in one of the deserted bays along the
      coast, was waiting for some signal to land her soldiers. The Bohemian
      probably had left this ship in order to come to Maison-Forte, bringing his
      pigeons with him, and it is well known with what intelligence these birds
      return to the places they are accustomed to inhabit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he raised his head to obtain another view of the horizon, the watchman
      saw in the distance, on the azure line which separated the sky from the
      sea, certain triangular sails of unusual height, which seemed to him
      suspicious. He turned his telescope on them; a second examination
      confirmed him in the idea that the chebec in sight belonged to some
      pirate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time he followed the manoeuvres of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of advancing to the coast, the chebec seemed to run along
      broadside, and to beat about, in spite of the increasing violence of the
      wind, as if it were waiting for a guide or signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman was trying to connect in his thought the sending of the
      pigeon with the appearance of this vessel of bad omen, when a light noise
      made him raise his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE LITTLE SATCHEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little satchel and the open letter were lying on the watchman&rsquo;s knees.
      With a movement more rapid than thought, which escaped the observation of
      the Bohemian, he hid the whole in his girdle. At the same time he assured
      himself that his long Catalonian knife would come out of its scabbard
      easily, for the sinister countenance of the vagabond did not inspire
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments these two men looked at each other in silence, and
      measured each other with their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although old, the watchman was still fresh and vigorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, more slender, was much younger, and seemed hardy and
      resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou was much annoyed by this visit. He wished to watch the manoeuvres
      of the suspicious chebec; the presence of the Bohemian constrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said the watchman, rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; I came to see the sun go down in the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a beautiful sight, but it can be seen elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, the watchman entered his cell, took two pistols,
      placed one in his girdle, loaded the other, took it in his hand, and came
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that time the chebec could be distinguished by the naked eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, seeing Peyrou armed, could not repress a movement of
      surprise, almost of vexation, but he said to him, in a bantering tone, as
      he pointed to the pistol:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You carry there a strange telescope, watchman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other is good to watch your enemy when he is far off; this one serves
      my purpose when he is near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what enemy are you speaking, watchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After exchanging these words, the men were silent for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. I am the guest of Raimond V., Baron des Anbiez,&rdquo; said
      the Bohemian, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the venomous scorpion, too, the guest of the house he inhabits?&rdquo;
       replied Peyrou, looking steadily in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the vagabond kindled, and, by a muscular contraction of his
      cheeks, Peyrou saw that he was gnashing his teeth; nevertheless, he
      replied to Peyrou, with affected calmness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deserve your reproaches, watchman. Raimond V. took pily on a
      poor wanderer, and offered me the hospitality of his roof&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to prove your gratitude to him, you wish to bring sorrow and ruin
      upon that roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you,&mdash;you are in communication with that chebec down there,
      beating about the horizon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian looked at the vessel with the most indifferent air in the
      world, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my life, I have never set foot on a ship; as to the communication
      which you suppose I have with that boat, that you call a chebec, I
      believe,&mdash;I doubt if my voice or my signal could reach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The watchman threw a penetrating glance on the Bohemian, and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never set foot on the deck of a ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, except on those boats on the Rhone, for I was born in Languedoc,
      on the highway; my father and mother belonged to a band of Bohemians which
      came from Spain, and the only recollection that I have of my childhood is
      the refrain so often sung in our wandering clan:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cuando me pario Mi madre la gitana.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I know of my birth,&mdash;all the family papers I have,
      watchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bohemians of Spain speak Arabic also,&rdquo; said Peyrou, observing the
      vagabond attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say so. I know no other language than the one I speak,&mdash;very
      badly, as you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun is setting behind those great clouds down there; for one who is
      fond of that sight you seem to be quite indifferent to it,&rdquo; answered the
      watchman, with an ironical air. &ldquo;No doubt the chebec interests you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow evening I can see the sun set; to-day I would rather spend my
      time in guessing your riddles, watchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation, the syndic of the overseers had not lost sight
      of the vessel, which continued to beat about, evidently waiting for a
      signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the appearance of this vessel was suspicious, Peyrou hesitated to
      give the alarm on the coast by kindling the fire. To set the whole
      seashore in excitement unnecessarily was a dangerous precedent, because
      some other time, in case of real danger, the signal might be taken for a
      false alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the watchman was absorbed in these reflections, the Bohemian looked
      around him uneasily; he was trying to discover some traces of the eagle,
      as from the rock where he had been squatting, he had seen Brilliant alight
      in this direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he thought of getting rid of Peyrou, but he soon renounced
      this idea. The watchman, strong and well-armed, was on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou, notwithstanding the anger that the presence of the vagabond
      inspired in him, feared to see him descend again to the castle of
      Maison-Forte, as Raimond V. did not suspect this wretch. Besides, seeing
      his wicked designs discovered, the villain might attempt some diabolical
      scheme before he left the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was impossible to abandon his sentry-box under such serious
      circumstances, in order to warn the baron. Night was approaching, and the
      Bohemian was still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, the moon was almost full; in spite of the densely piled clouds,
      her light was bright enough to reveal all the manoeuvres of the chebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, his arms crossed on his breast, surveyed Peyrou, with
      imperturbable coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the sun has set,&rdquo; said this old seaman, &ldquo;the night will be cold;
      you had better return to Maison-Forte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to spend the night here,&rdquo; replied the vagabond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman, made furious by the remark, rose, and walking up to the
      Bohemian with a threatening air, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by Our Lady, I swear that you shall descend to the beach this
      instant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I do not wish to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not kill me, watchman, and I will remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou raised his pistol, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you kill a defenceless man, who has never done you any harm? I defy
      you,&rdquo; said the vagabond, without moving from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman dropped his arm; he revolted at the thought of murder. He
      replaced his pistol in his belt, and walked back and forth in violent
      agitation. He found himself in a singular position,&mdash;he could not rid
      himself of this persistent villain by fear or force; he must then resolve
      to pass the night on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resigned himself to this last alternative, hoping that next day some
      one might appear, and he would be able to rid himself of the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let it be,&rdquo; said he, with a forced smile. &ldquo;Although I have not
      invited you to be my companion, we will pass the night by the side of each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will not repent it, watchman. I am not a sailor, but I have a
      telescope. If the chebec annoys you, I will assist you in watching it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some moments of silence, the watchman seated himself on a piece of
      the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind, increasing in violence, blew with irresistible force. Great
      clouds from time to time veiled the pale disc of the moon, and the door of
      the sentry-box, left open, was flapping with a loud noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish to be of some use,&rdquo; said Peyrou, &ldquo;take that end of the rope
      there on the ground, and fasten the door of my cell, because the wind will
      continue to rise.&rdquo; The Bohemian looked at the watchman with an astonished
      air, and hesitated to obey for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to shut me up in there. You are cunning, watchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou bit his lips, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fasten that door on the outside, I tell you, or I will take you for a bad
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, seeing nothing disagreeable in satisfying the watchman,
      picked up the rope, passed it through a ring screwed to the door, and tied
      it to a cramp-iron fixed in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman, seated, was attentively watching the movements of his
      companion. When the knot was tied, Peyrou approached it, and said, after
      examining it a moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as God is in heaven, you are a sailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, watchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have served on board those corsairs from Barbary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that one who has not sailed with the pirates of Algiers or
      Tunis cannot have the habit of making that triple knot that you have just
      made. Only pirates fasten tie anchor to the ring in that manner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian now, in his turn, bit his lips until they bled, but,
      regaining his self-possession, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, you have a sharp eye; you are both right and wrong, my lord
      watchman, this knot was taught me by one of our people, who joined us in
      Languedoc, after having been made a slave on a corsair from Algiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Losing all patience, and furious at the villain&rsquo;s impudence, the watchman
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that you are lying. You came here to prepare some villainous
      scheme. Look at this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the watchman held up the little satchel The Bohemian, struck with
      amazement, uttered a curse in Arabic in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the watchman had felt the least doubt concerning the character of the
      Bohemian, this last exclamation, which had so often met his ears in his
      combats with the pirates, would have sufficed to prove the truth of his
      suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the Bohemian flashed with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see all,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the eagle came here to devour the pigeon! From the
      beach I saw her alight in these rocks. That satchel or your life!&rdquo; cried
      the villain, drawing a dagger from his doublet, and rushing upon the
      watchman. The pistol on Peyrou&rsquo;s breast recalled the fact to him that his
      enemy was more formidably armed than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stamping his foot with rage, the vagabond cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eblis (<i>Eblis is the Arabic for devil</i>) is with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it, you are a pirate. That chebec is waiting for your
      instructions, or your signal to approach the coast or retire from it. Your
      rage is great to see all your wicked designs discovered, you villain!&rdquo;
       said the watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eblis touched me with his invisible wingt so that I was about to forget
      the only means of repairing everything,&rdquo; suddenly cried the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one joyous bound he disappeared from the astonished eyes of the
      watchman, and hastily descended the precipitous road which led to the
      shore.

      CHAPTER XX. THE SACRIFICE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The night passed without another incident.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the rising of the sun the chebec was no longer in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou waited with impatience the arrival of the young seaman who was
      accustomed to relieve his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was anxious to warn Raimond V. of the wicked designs he attributed to
      the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two o&rsquo;clock, Peyrou was astonished to see Mile, des Anbiez,
      accompanied by Stephanette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine approached him with evident embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without sharing the superstitious ideas of the inhabitants of the gulf, in
      reference to the watchman on Cape l&rsquo;Aigle, she felt irresistibly impelled
      to consult him upon a subject which she could not think of without
      sadness. The young girl had received new evidences of the remembrance
      cherished by Erebus, through the same unknown and mysterious way.
    </p>
    <p>
      All her efforts, and all of Stephanette&rsquo;s, had proved unavailing in
      discovering the source of these strange communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through an unpardonable obstinacy, and a foolish love of the marvellous,
      Reine had concealed everything from her father and Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât had left Maison-Forte, in a fit of jealousy as painful as it was
      unreasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day the overseers of the port held their session,
      Reine, as she knelt before her praying-desk, had found a rosary of
      sandalwood of the most marvellous workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clasp by which it was to be attached to her belt again bore the
      enamelled imprint of the little dove of which we have spoken,&mdash;the
      symbol of the remembrance and the love of the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the singing of the Bohemian, Reine&rsquo;s imagination, excited beyond
      degree, had indulged in a thousand dreams concerning the adventurous life
      of the young emir, as the vagabond had named him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either by design or chance, the singer had left his guzla in Reine&rsquo;s
      apartment, after the departure of Honorât de Berrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl, curious to see the face of the unknown again, took the
      guitar and opened the medallion, and, to her great surprise, the portrait,
      insecurely fastened, came off in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dame Dulceline entered. Reine blushed, closed the medallion and hid the
      portrait in her bosom, intending to restore it to its place. Evening came,
      and Stephanette, without informing her mistress, returned the guitar to
      the Bohemian. The lid of the medallion was fastened, and neither the
      singer nor the servant discovered the absence of the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Reine sent for the Bohemian in order to return the portrait
      to him. He had disappeared, the flight of the pigeon demanding his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine had the courage to break the crystal vase, and to burn the miniature
      on vellum, but she had not the courage to destroy the portrait or the
      rosary that she found in her oratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her struggles, in spite of her prayers, in spite of her
      resolve to forget the events of the day in the rocks of Ollioules, the
      memory of the unknown took possession of her heart more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The songs of the Bohemian on the young emir, whom he called Erebus, had
      profoundly moved her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those contrasts of courage and kindness, of power and pity, recalled to
      her mind the singular combination of audacity and timidity which had
      impressed her in the scene which transpired in the gorges of Ollioules.
    </p>
    <p>
      She counted on the restitution of the portrait as the first step to
      another conversation with the Singer about the emir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the Bohemian had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great astonishment of the inmates of Maison-Forte, he did not
      return in the evening. Raimond V., who liked him, ordered his men who
      guarded the bridge to be prepared to lower it when the Bohemian appeared,
      notwithstanding the regulations of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, and still the vagabond was absent. They supposed that, after
      drinking, he had fallen asleep in some tavern of La Ciotat. They were
      still more astonished not to find the two pigeons in the cage where he
      kept them ordinarily closely confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatly disturbed by these strange happenings, which had been transpiring
      for some time, Reine, half through curiosity and half through conviction,
      finally yielded to the entreaties of Stephanette, who had the most
      wonderful ideas of the watchman&rsquo;s abilities and knowledge, and decided to
      consult the old seaman on the mysteries of which Maison-Forte was the
      theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many extraordinary things had been told of Master Peyrou&rsquo;s predictions,
      that Reine, although little given to superstition, felt the influence of
      the general opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going to interrogate Peyrou, when, to her amazement, he accosted
      her with a question about the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, did the vagabond enter Maison-Forte last night?&rdquo; said
      Peyrou, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; my father is much concerned about him. They think that he must have
      spent the night drinking in some tavern in La Ciotat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be astonishing,&rdquo; added Stephanette, &ldquo;for the poor fellow seems
      to be of exemplary sobriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This poor fellow,&rdquo; exclaimed the watchman, &ldquo;is a spy of the pirates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; exclaimed Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he, himself, mademoiselle; a chebec was cruising a part of the night
      in view from the gulf, waiting, no doubt, for a signal from this vagabond
      to disembark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few words the watchman acquainted Reine with the adventure of the
      pigeon, informing her on what indisputable grounds he suspected the
      Bohemian of having communication with the pirates; showed her the satchel
      and letter, and gave them to her, that the baron might have the writing
      translated by one of the brother monks in La Ciotat, who, having been a
      slave in Tunis for a long time, was familiar with Arabic.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she learned the odious suspicions which attached to the Bohemian,
      without accounting to herself for her fear, Reine dared not confide the
      object of her visit to the watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette looked at her mistress, utterly confounded, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Lady! who would have believed that this unbeliever, who sang so well,
      could be such an abominable scoundrel? And to think I pitied him enough to
      give him a flame-coloured ribbon! Ah, my dear mistress, and the portrait
      of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine by an imperious sign forbade Stephanette to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, good watchman,&rdquo; said Mlle, des Anbiez, &ldquo;I am going back to
      Maison-Forte at once, to warn my father to be on his guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget, Stephanette, to send Luquin Trinquetaille here. I must
      make arrangements with him to have one more young watchman,&rdquo; said Peyrou.
      &ldquo;I have not slept the whole night. This dangerous knave is perhaps
      wandering about these rocks, and may come and assassinate me at the
      setting of the moon. The pirates are somewhere in the gulf, hidden in some
      one of the coves where they often ambuscade, to wait for their prey; for,
      alas! our coasts are not protected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be easy, Master Peyrou, Luquin is coming with his two cousins; just tell
      him that you are watching for the Bohemian, and he will not delay to come
      as fast as his long legs can bring him. And to think I gave a ribbon to a
      pirate!&rdquo; added Stephanette, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Perhaps he is one of
      those brigands who ravaged all this coast last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, go, my girl, and hurry. I must confer with the captain about a little
      cruise he can undertake even to-day with his polacre. We must warn the
      consuls to arm some fishing-boats immediately, with sure and determined
      men. We must give the alarm all along the shore, arm the entrance into the
      gulf, which is defended only by the cannon of Maison-Forte, and be
      prepared for any surprise, for these brigands rush on the coast like a
      hurricane. So Luquin must come on the instant Do you hear, Stephanette?
      The safety of the city depends on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be easy, Master Peyrou, although it breaks my heart to know that my poor
      Luquin is going to run such danger. I love him too much to advise him to
      be a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this rapid conversation between the watchman and her servant,
      Reine, lost in deep reverie, had descended a few steps of the path which
      conducted to the platform upon which stood the sentry-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      This path, which was very steep, wound around the outside of the
      promontory, and formed at this spot a sort of comice, whose projection
      reached considerably over the base of this immense wall of rocks, more
      than three hundred feet above the level of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young girl less habituated to walks and to mountain climbing would have
      feared to venture on this narrow passage. From the side of the sea, its
      only parapet was a few asperities of rock, more or less pronounced. Reine,
      accustomed to brave these perils from her infancy, thought nothing of
      danger. The emotion that agitated her since her interview with the
      watchman absorbed her entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gait, sometimes slow, sometimes hurried, seemed to share the nature of
      her tumultuous emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette soon joined her. Surprised at the pallor of her mistress, she
      was about to ask the cause of it, when Reine said to her, in an altered
      voice, with a gesture which did not admit of a reply, &ldquo;Walk in front of
      me, Stephanette, do not concern yourself whether I follow you or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette preceded her mistress at once, directing her steps in all
      haste toward Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agitation of Reine des Anbiez was extreme. The relations which seemed
      to exist between the Bohemian and the unknown were too evident for her not
      to have the most painful suspicions of this young man whom the vagabond
      called the emir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many circumstances, which had not impressed her at the time, now made
      Reine believe that the Bohemian was an emissary of the unknown. No doubt
      it was the vagabond who had placed in her chamber the various objects
      which had caused her so much surprise. Adopting this hypothesis, there
      was, however, one objection which presented itself to her mind,&mdash;she
      had found the crystal vase and the miniature on vellum before the arrival
      of the vagabond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a ray of light entered her mind; she remembered that one day, in
      order to display his agility to Stephanette, the Bohemian had descended to
      the terrace by the balcony, upon which opened the window of her oratory,
      and that he had remounted by the same way. Another time he had slid down
      from the terrace on the rocks, which lined the shore, and had remounted
      from the rocks to the terrace, by the aid of the asperities of the wall
      and the plants which had taken root there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he arrived for the first time at the castle with the recorder,
      might not this vagabond, before that day, have been hidden in the
      environage of La Ciotat? Could he not have entered Maison-Forte twice
      during the night, then, to avoid suspicion, returned in the recorder&rsquo;s
      train, as if he had met it by chance?
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts, reinforced by recent observations, soon assumed
      incontrovertible certainty in the mind of Reine. The stranger and his two
      companions were, without doubt, pirates, who, with false names and false
      credentials, had given out that they were Muscovites, and had thus imposed
      upon the credulity of the Marshal of Vitry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first idea of Reine, then,&mdash;an idea absolute and imperious,&mdash;was
      to forget for ever the man upon whom rested such terrible suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion, duty, and the will of her father were so many insurmountable and
      sacred obstacles which the young girl could not think of braving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that time, her youthful and lively imagination had found
      inexhaustible nourishment in the strange adventure of the rocks of
      Ollioules.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the chaste dreams of her young girlhood were, so to speak,
      concentrated and realised in the person of Erebus, that unknown one, brave
      and timid at the same time, audacious and charming, who had saved the life
      of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help being touched by the delicate and mysterious
      persistence with which Erebus had always tried to recall himself to her
      memory. Doubtless she had never heard the voice of this stranger;
      doubtless she was ignorant of his mind and character, whether or not they
      responded to the graces of his person. But in these long reveries in which
      a young girl thinks of him who has fascinated her, does she not invest him
      with the most excellent qualities? does she not make him say all that she
      desires to hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus had Reine thought of Erebus. First she wished to banish him from her
      thought, but, unfortunately, to yield to a sentiment against which we have
      struggled is only to render it all the more powerful and irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine then loved Erebus, perhaps unconsciously, when the watchman&rsquo;s fatal
      revelation showed the object of her love in such unattractive colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandeur of the sacrifice that she was required to make enlightened
      her as to the power of the affection with which she had, so to speak,
      played until the fatal moment arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time this sudden revelation taught her the depth of her
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impenetrable mysteries of the human heart! During the first phases of this
      mysterious love she had regarded her marriage with Honorât as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment in which she knew who the unknown one was, from that
      moment she felt that, notwithstanding the voice of duty ordered her to
      forget him, the memory of Erebus would henceforth dominate her whole
      existence, and she could never marry the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognised the truth with terror, that, notwithstanding her efforts to
      master her feelings, her heart belonged to her no longer, and she was
      incapable of deceiving Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished to make a last sacrifice, to give up the rosary and portrait
      which she possessed, imposing this resolution upon herself as a sort of
      expiation of her reserve and reticence toward her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl suffered much before she was able to fulfil this
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mental struggle, Reine was walking on the edge of the comice
      formed by the rocks above the beach on which the waves of the sea were
      breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore over her dress a sort of brown mantle with a hood turned up on
      the shoulders. This hood allowed her bare head to be seen, as well as her
      long brown curls that floated in the wind. Her countenance had an
      expression of sweet and resigned melancholy; sometimes, however, her blue
      eyes shone with a new brightness, and she lifted up her noble, beautiful
      head with an expression of wounded pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved passionately, but without hope, and she was going to throw to
      the winds the feeble tokens of this impossible love.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her feet, far, far below her, broke the raging waves of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew the rosary from her bosom, looked at it a moment with bitterness,
      pressed it to her heart, then, extending her white and delicate hand above
      the abyss, she held it motionless a moment, and the rosary fell into the
      waves below.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to follow it with her eyes, but the edge of the cornice was too
      sharp to allow her a view.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed profoundly, took the portrait of the unknown, and contemplated
      it a long time in sad admiration. Nothing could be purer or more
      enchanting than the features of Erebus; his large brown eyes, soft and
      proud at the same time, reminded her of the look, full of purity and
      dignity, which he cast upon Raimond V. after having saved his life. The
      smile of this portrait, full of serenity, had nothing of that satirical
      smile and bold expression which had so startled her on the eventful day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments she struggled with her resolution, then reason asserted
      her empire; blushing, she pressed her lips to the medallion, then on the
      brow of the portrait, and then&mdash;threw it suddenly into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      This painful sacrifice accomplished, Reine felt less oppressed; she
      believed that she would have committed a wrong in preserving these
      memorials of a foolish love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she felt free to abandon herself to the thoughts locked in the depths
      of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked a long time on the beach, absorbed in these thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to Maison-Forte she learned that Raimond V. had not yet
      returned from the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was fast falling, and Reine, followed by Stephanette, entered her
      apartment What was her amazement, her terror&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She found on the table the portrait and rosary that two hours before she
      had thrown into the depths of the sea.

      CHAPTER XXI. OUR LADY OF SEVEN SORROWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will abandon for awhile Maison-Forte of the Baron des Anbiez, and the
      little city of La Ciotat, in order to conduct the reader on board the
      galley of the commander Pierre des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tempest had forced this vessel to take refuge in the little port of
      Tolari, situated on the east of Cape Corsica, a northerly point of the
      island of the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell of the galley had just sounded six o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was gloomy and the sky veiled with black and threatening
      clouds; frequent and violent squalls of wind were raising a strong swell
      within the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      On whichever side one might turn, nothing could be seen but the barren,
      solemn mountains of Cape Corsica, at the feet of which the steep road
      wound its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea was heavy in the interior of the basin, but it seemed almost calm
      when compared to the surging waves which beat upon a girdle of rocks at
      the narrow entrance of the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rocks, almost entirely submerged, were covered with a dazzling foam,
      which, whipped by the wind, vented itself in a soft white mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp cries of sea-gulls and sea-mews scarcely rose above the
      thundering noise of the sea in its fury, as it rushed into the channel
      which it was necessary to cross in order to enter the road of Tolari.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few wretched-looking fishermen&rsquo;s huts, built on the beach where their
      dried boats were moored, completed the wild and solitary scene. Tossed by
      this heavy swell, <i>Our Lady of Seven Sorrows</i>, sometimes rising on
      the waves, would strain her cables almost to breaking, and sometimes
      seemed to sink into a bed between two billows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be severer or more funereal than the aspect of this galley
      painted like a cenotaph.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred and sixty-six feet long, eighteen feet wide, narrow, slender,
      and scarcely rising above the level of the sea, she resembled an immense
      black serpent, sleeping in the midst of the waves. In front of the
      parallelogram which constituted the body of the galley, was scarfed a
      sharp and projecting beak-head, six feet in length.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the rear of the same parallelogram was a rounded stern, the roof of
      which inclined toward the prow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this shelter, called the stem carriage, lodged the commander, the
      patron, the prior, and the king of the chevaliers of Malta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masts of the galley, hauled down at its entrance into harbour, had
      been placed in the waist, a narrow passage which ran through the entire
      length of the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each side of this passage were ranged the benches of the galley-slaves.
      Below the stem carriage, attached to a black staff, floated the standard
      of religion, red, quartered with white, and below the standard a bronze
      beacon designated the grade of the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult, in our day, to comprehend how these slaves,
      composing the crew of a galley, could live, chained night and day to their
      benches,&mdash;at sea, lying on deck without shelter; at anchor, lying
      under a tent of coarse, woollen stuff, which scarcely protected them from
      the rain and the frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let one picture to himself about one hundred and thirty Moorish, Turk, or
      Christian galley-slaves, dressed in red jackets and brown woollen hooded
      mantles, on this black galley, in cold, gloomy weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      These miserable creatures shivered under the icy blast of the tempest and
      under the rain, which deluged them notwithstanding the awning.
    </p>
    <p>
      To warm themselves a little they would press close to each other on the
      narrow benches, to which they were chained, five and five.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of them preserved a morose silence, and often threw an uneasy and
      furtive glance on the convict-keepers and the overseers.
    </p>
    <p>
      These contemptible officers, clothed in black, and armed with a cowhide,
      would go through the waist of the galley, on each side of which were the
      benches of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were thirteen benches on the right, and twelve on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The galley-slaves, constituting the palamente, or the armament of rowers,
      belonging to <i>Our Lady of Seven Sorrows</i>, had been, as was the
      custom, recruited from Christians, Turks, and Moors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one of these types of slaves had his peculiar physiognomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turks, sluggish, dejected, and indolent, seemed to be a prey to a
      morbid and contemplative apathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moors, always excited, uneasy, and of ungovernable temper, appeared to
      be continually on the alert to break their chains and massacre their
      keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christians, whether condemned or enrolled of their own will, were, in
      their way, more indifferent, and some of them were occupied in weaving
      straw, by which they hoped to reap a profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the negroes, captured from Barbary pirate vessels where they
      rowed as slaves, remained in a sort of torpor, a stupid immobility, with
      their elbows on their knees and their heads in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of these blacks died of grief, while the Mussulman and
      Christians grew accustomed to their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these last, some were horribly mutilated, as they belonged to the
      class recaptured in their efforts to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to punish them for attempting to escape, according to the law,
      their noses and ears had been cut off, and even more than this, their
      beards, heads, and eyebrows were completely shaven; nothing could be more
      hideous than the faces so disfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fore part of the galley, and confined in a sort of covered
      guard-house, called rambade, could be seen a battery,&mdash;the five
      pieces of artillery belonging to the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This place was occupied by the soldiers and gunners.
    </p>
    <p>
      These never formed a part of the crew, but composed, if such a thing may
      be said, the cargo of the vessel impelled by the oars of the
      galley-slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twenty sailors, free also, were charged with the management of the
      sails, with the anchorage, and other nautical manoeuvres.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers and gunners, considered as lay brothers and servants, wore
      coats of buff-skin, hoods, and black breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheltered by the roof of the rambade, some, seated on their cannon, busied
      themselves in cleaning their arms; others, wrapped in their hoods, lay on
      the deck asleep, while others still&mdash;a rare thing even among the
      soldiers of religion&mdash;were occupied in pious reading, or in telling
      their rosaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of the galley-slaves, the men on board this galley,
      carefully chosen by the commander, had a grave and thoughtful countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all the soldiers and sailors were of mature age; some were
      approaching old age. By the numerous scars with which the greater number
      were marked, it was evident that they had served a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than two hundred men were assembled on this galley, and yet the
      silence of the cloister reigned through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the crew remained silent through terror of the whip of the keepers and
      overseers, the soldiers and sailors obeyed the pious customs maintained by
      the commander Pierre des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than thirty years that he had commanded this galley of religion,
      he had tried always to preserve the same equipment, replacing only the men
      that he had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severity of discipline established on board Our Lady of Seven Sorrows
      was well known at Malta. The commander was perhaps the only one of the
      officers of the religion who exacted a strict observance of the rules of
      the order. His galley, on board of which he received only men who had been
      proven, became a sort of nomadic convent,&mdash;a voluntary rendezvous for
      all sailors who wished to assure their salvation by binding themselves
      scrupulously to the rigorous requirements of this hospitable and military
      confraternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same with the officers and young caravan-iflits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who preferred to lead a joyous and daring life&mdash;which was the
      immense majority&mdash;found the greater part of the captains of the
      religion disposed to welcome them, and to forget everything in their union
      against the infidels, as their mission of monk-soldiers was at the same
      time that of saint and warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, the very small number of young chevaliers who loved, for
      its own sake, this pious and austere life in the midst of great perils,
      sought with eagerness the opportunity to embark on the galley of the
      commander Pierre des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      There nothing offended, nothing prevented their religious customs. There
      they could give themselves up to their holy exercises without fear of
      being ridiculed, or of becoming perhaps weak enough to blush for their own
      zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master gunner, or captain of the mast of the galley, an old sunburnt
      soldier, wearing a black felt jacket with a white cross, was seated in the
      guard-house of the prow, or rambade, of which we have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking with the captain of the sailors of <i>Our Lady of Seven
      Sorrows</i>, whose name was Simon. The first speaker was Captain Hugues,
      who, with his companion, had always sailed with the Commander des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hugues was polishing with care a collar of steel net. Captain
      Simon from time to time was looking through the opening of the rambade,
      examining the sky and the sea, so as to prognosticate the end or the
      increase of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Hugues to Simon, &ldquo;the north wind blows strong; it will be
      several days before we arrive at La Ciotat. Christmas will be past, and
      our brother commander will be grieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Simon, before replying to his comrade, consulted the horizon
      again, and said, with a serious air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although it is not proper for man to seek to divine the will of the Lord,
      I think we may hope to see the end of this tempest soon: the clouds seem
      not so low or so heavy. Perhaps to-morrow our ancient companion, the old
      watchman on Cape l&rsquo;Aigle, will signal our arrival in the Gulf of La
      Ciotat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that will be a day of joy in Maison-Forte, and to Raimond V.,&rdquo; said
      Captain Hugues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also on board <i>Our Lady of Seven Sorrows</i>,&rdquo; said Captain Simon,
      &ldquo;although joy appears here as rarely as the sun during a westerly wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at this furbished collar,&rdquo; said the gunner, regarding his work with
      an air of satisfaction. &ldquo;It is strange, Brother Simon, how blood will
      stick to steel. I have rubbed in vain: you can always distinguish these
      blackish marks on the mesh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which proves that steel loves blood as the earth loves dew,&rdquo; said the
      sailor, smiling sadly at his pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know,&rdquo; said Hugues, &ldquo;that it will soon be ten years since the
      commander received this wound in his combat with Mourad-Reis, the corsair
      of Algiers?&rdquo; &ldquo;I remember it as well, brother, as that with one blow of the
      battle-axe I struck down the miscreant who had almost broken his kangiar
      on the breast of the commander, who was fortunately defended by that coat
      of mail. But for that, Pierre des Anbiez would be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he still keeps this collar, and I am going to carry it to him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the sailor, seizing the gunner by the arm, &ldquo;you have chosen
      an unfortunate time,&mdash;the brother commander is in one of his bad
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The head cook told me this morning that Father Elzear wished to enter the
      commander&rsquo;s chamber, but there was crape on the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, I understand; that sign suffices to prevent the entrance of
      any person in the commander&rsquo;s chamber before he gives the order to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet to-day is neither Saturday nor the seventeenth day of the month,&rdquo;
       said Captain Hugues with a thoughtful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, for it is only upon the return of these days that his fits
      of despondency seem to overwhelm him the most,&rdquo; said Captain Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment a deep, hollow murmur was heard outside among the
      crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing ominous of evil in this noise; on the contrary, it was
      only an expression of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked the gunner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless Reverend Father Elzear has just appeared on deck. At the very
      sight of him the slaves think their lot less miserable.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. THE BROTHER OF MERCY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elzear des Anbiez, brother of the sacred order, royal and military, of Our
      Lady of Mercy, for the redemption of captives, had in fact just appeared
      on the deck of the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slaves welcomed his presence with a murmur of hope and satisfaction,
      for he always had some word of pity for these unhappy men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recognised discipline of the galley was so severe, so inflexible, and
      of such relentless justice, that Father Elzear, notwithstanding the tender
      attachment which bound him to his brother, the commander, would not have
      dared ask the pardon of an offender. But he never spared encouragement and
      consolation to those who were to undergo punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear advanced with a slow step into the middle of the narrow
      passage which separated the two rows of benches on the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore the habit of his order: a long white cassock, with a mantle of the
      same material caught up on the shoulders. A rope girded his loins, and
      notwithstanding the cold, his bare feet had no other protection than
      leather sandals. In the middle of his breast showed the coat of arms
      belonging to his order, an escutcheon diapered with gold and gules,
      surmounted with a silver cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear resembled Raimond V. His features were noble and majestic,
      but the fatigues and austerities of his holy, self-abnegating profession
      had stamped upon them an expression of constant suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top of his head was shaven, and a crown of white hair encircled his
      venerable brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pale, emaciated face, his hollow cheeks, made his soft, serene black
      eyes appear larger still, and a sweet, sad smile gave an expression of
      adorable benevolence to his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped a little in walking, as if he had contracted this habit by
      bending over the chained captives. His weak wrists were marked with deep
      and ineffaceable scars. Captured in one of the numerous voyages he made
      from France to Barbary for the ransom of slaves, he had been put in
      chains, and so cruelly treated that he bore all his life the marks of the
      barbarity practised by pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been ransomed by his own family, he voluntarily went into slavery
      again in order to take the place in an Algerian prison of a poor
      inhabitant of La Ciotat, who could not pay his ransom, and whom a dying
      mother called to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In forty years he had ransomed more than three thousand slaves, either
      with the money of his own patrimony, or with the fruit of his collections
      from other Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of a few months passed, every two or three years, in
      the house of his brother Raimond V., Father Elzear, noble, rich, learned,
      with an independent fortune, which he had devoted to the ransom of slaves,
      had been travelling continually, either on land for the purpose of
      collecting alms, or on sea, on his way to deliver captives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacredly vowed to this hard and pious mission, he had always refused the
      positions and rank that his birth, his virtues, his courage, and his
      angelic piety would have conferred upon him in his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      His self-abnegation, his simplicity, which possessed an antique grandeur,
      struck all minds with respect and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Endowed naturally with a noble and lofty spirit, he had directed all the
      powers of his soul toward one single aim, that of giving consolation, by
      imparting to his language that irresistible charm which won and comforted
      the afflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a triumph it was for him, when his tender, sympathising words
      gave a little hope and courage to the poor slaves chained to their oars,
      when he saw their eyes, hard and dry from despair, turn to him moist with
      the sweet tears of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are overwhelmed with admiration when we reflect upon those lives so
      unostentatiously devoted to one of the most exalted and most sacred
      missions of humanity. We are lost in wonder when we think of the sublime
      fortitude of these men, voluntarily placed under the very cutlasses of
      cruel pirates. We are speechless with amazement when we think of the men
      who risked their lives every day in order to exhort the slaves, whom
      barbarians oppressed with labours and tormented with blows, to patience
      and resignation. What unbounded self-sacrifice and long suffering were
      demanded of those Brothers of Mercy who went and ransomed, in the midst of
      the greatest perils, people whom in all probability they were never to see
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest and the missionary enjoy, for a time at least, the good which
      they have accomplished, the gratitude of those whom they have instructed,
      relieved, or saved; but the men who devoted themselves to the redemption
      of slaves held by pirates, were hardly acquainted with the captives whom
      they delivered, inasmuch as they left them for ever, after having given
      them the most precious of all boons, liberty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, it was a joyous day for the Brothers of Mercy when those
      whom they had ransomed embarked for Marseilles, and there in the church
      offered solemn thanks to Heaven for their deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little children clothed in white, holding green palms in their hands,
      accompanied them, and their tender hands removed the chains from the
      captives, a touching symbol of the mission of the Brothers of Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Father Elzear appeared on the deck of the galley, all the chained
      slaves turned to him with a simultaneous movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every step he took, the captives, Moor, Turk, or Christian, leaning
      beyond their benches, tried to seize his hands and carry them to their
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Father Elzear was accustomed to receive these evidences of
      respect and affection, he was never able to prevent tears coming to his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never, perhaps, had his pity been more excited than to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was cold and gloomy, the horizon charged with tempest, the
      environage wild and solitary, and these poor creatures, the greater number
      of them accustomed to the hot sun of the Orient, were there half naked,
      shivering with cold, and chained perhaps for life to their benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the compassion of Father Elzear was equally divided among all, he
      could not help bestowing most pity upon those whose lots seemed to him the
      most desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his departure from Malta, where he had joined his brother with ten
      captives that he had carried back to La Ciotat, he had observed a Moorish
      slave about forty years old, whose countenance betrayed an incurable
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man of the crew fulfilled his painful task with more courage or more
      resignation. But as soon as the hour of rest arrived, the Moor crossed his
      vigorous arms, bowed his head on his breast, and thus passed the hours in
      which his comrades tried to forget their captivity, in gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the mast on the galley, knowing the interest that this
      gentle and peaceable captive inspired in Father Elzear, approached the
      priest, and told him the Moor was about to suffer the usual punishment for
      insubordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning, this Moor, plunged in his profound and habitual reverie, had
      not responded to the commands of the overseer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer reprimanded him sharply, and still the Moor sat in gloomy
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incensed by this indifference, which he construed into an insult or a
      refusal to submit to service, the overseer struck him over the shoulders
      with the cowhide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor jumped up, uttered a savage roar, and threw himself on the
      overseer to the full length of his chain, throwing him down in the
      violence of his rage, and, but for several sailors and soldiers, would
      have strangled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captive who raised his hand against one of the officers of the galley
      was subjected to terrible punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to be stretched half naked on one of the largest cannon in the
      rambade, called the chase-gun, and two men, armed with sharp thongs, were
      to lash him until he lost consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sentence had been pronounced that morning on the Moor by the
      commander. Knowing the inflexible character of his brother, Elzear did not
      think of asking mercy for the offender; he only desired to soften the
      cruelty of the sentence by informing the captive himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor had but recently embarked, and was utterly ignorant of the fate
      which awaited him. Father Elzear feared that, by informing him suddenly or
      sternly of the punishment he was about to undergo, the poor captive might
      give way to another outburst of fury, and thus incur additional suffering.
      Approaching him, he found him in that condition of torpor and melancholy
      into which he always sank when not in the exercise of his painful tasks.
      He wore, like the other galley-slaves, a mantle of gray stuff with a hood,
      and linen drawers; an iron band encircled one of his naked legs, and the
      chain by which he was fastened reached the length of an iron bar from the
      side of the bench. His hood, drawn over the fez or red wool cap which he
      wore, threw a transparent shade over his sunburnt face; he held his arms
      crossed over his breast; his fixed and open eyes seemed to look without
      seeing; his features were delicate and regular, and his whole exterior
      announced nothing except a man habituated to fatigue and hard labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear, as did the greater number of the Brothers of Mercy, spoke
      Arabic fluently. He approached the captive gently, and, touching him
      lightly on the arm, woke him from his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he recognised Father Elzear, who had always had for him a consoling
      word, the Moor smiled sadly, took the hand of the priest, and pressed it
      to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is always absorbed in his sorrows?&rdquo; said Father Elzear,
      seating himself on the extremity of the bench, and taking the two hands of
      the slave in his own trembling, venerable hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife and my child are far away,&rdquo; replied the Moor, sadly; &ldquo;they do not
      know that I am a captive; they are waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear son must not lose all hope, all courage. God protects those who
      suffer with resignation. He loves those who love their own; my brother
      will see his wife and child again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Moor shook his head, then, with a sadly expressive manner, he lifted
      his right hand and pointed to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear comprehended the mute gesture, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not up there that my brother will see again those whom he longs
      for. It will be here,&mdash;on the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall die too soon, father, so far from my wife and child; I shall not
      live to see them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought never to despair of the divine mercy, my brother. Many poor
      slaves have said, like you, &lsquo;I shall never see my loved ones again,&rsquo; yet
      at this moment they are with their own, peaceful and happy. Often the
      galleys of religion exchange their captives; why, my brother, should you
      not be included some day in these exchanges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day! Perhaps! That is my only hope,&rdquo; said the Moor, despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, unhappy man! then why will you say &lsquo;never&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is right. Never,&mdash;never&mdash;oh, that would be too
      horrible! Yes,&mdash;perhaps,&mdash;some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a pathetic smile played upon the lips of the Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear hesitated to make the fatal confidence. Yet the hour was
      approaching and he resolved to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother has won the confidence of all by his gentleness and courage;
      why, then, this morning did he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear could not continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor looked at him, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this morning, instead of obeying the overseer&rsquo;s orders, did my
      brother strike him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I struck him, father, because he struck me without cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! no doubt you were, as a little while ago, absorbed in your sad
      reflections; they prevented your hearing the overseer&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he give me orders?&rdquo; asked the Moor, with a startled air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice, my brother; he even reprimanded you for not performing them.
      Taking your silence for an insult, he then struck you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be as you say, father. I repent having struck the overseer. I did
      not hear him. In dreaming of the past, I forgot the present. I saw again
      my little home in Gigeri; my little Acoub came to meet me. I was listening
      to his voice, and, raising my eyes, I saw his mother opening the blinds of
      our balcony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with these words, returning to his former position, the Moor bowed
      his head in heaviness and despondency, and two tears flowed down his
      bronzed cheeks, as he said, with a heartrending expression: &ldquo;And then,
      nothing more,&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the aspect of this man, already so unhappy, the good brother shuddered
      at the thought of what he must tell him; he was on the point of giving up
      the painful mission, but he took courage, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry that my brother was so absorbed this morning, because I
      know he did not mean to strike the overseer. But, alas, discipline demands
      that he must be punished for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, father, that I was not able to repress my first movement.
      Since my captivity, it was the first happy dream I have had. The blows of
      the whip tore me away from this cherished dream. I was furious, not with
      pain, but with sorrow. Besides, what matters it? I am a slave here; I will
      endure the punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this punishment is cruel, my poor, unfortunate brother,&mdash;it is
      so cruel that I will not leave you during its execution; it is so cruel
      that I will be near you, and I will pray for you, and my loving hands at
      least shall clasp your hands contracted in agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Moor looked at Father Elzear intently, then said, with an accent of
      resignation, almost of indifference:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I have, then, to suffer so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, without replying to him, pressed his hands more strongly in
      his own, and fixed his tearful eyes on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I did my duty as a slave, the best that I could possibly do. But what
      matters it!&rdquo; said the Moor, sighing; &ldquo;God will bless you, father, for not
      forsaking me. And when am I to suffer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day&mdash;presently&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must I do, good old father? Bear it, and bless God that he has sent
      you to me in this fatal moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor creature!&rdquo; cried Father Elzear, profoundly moved by this
      resignation, &ldquo;you do not know, alas, what you will have to suffer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, with a trembling voice, the priest explained to him in a few words
      the nature of the suffering he was to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor shuddered a little, and said: &ldquo;At least, my wife and child will
      know nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the captain of the mast and four soldiers, wearing cassocks
      of black felt with white crosses, approached the bench to which the Moor
      was chained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugues,&rdquo; said Father Elzear to the captain, &ldquo;suspend the execution, I
      pray you, until I have spoken with my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The discipline established on the galley was so severe, so absolute, that
      the gunner looked at the priest with an undecided air, but, thanks to the
      respect that Father Elzear inspired, he did not dare refuse his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father hastened to the chamber of the commander, in order to intercede
      with him for the unhappy Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having crossed the narrow passage which conducted to his brother&rsquo;s
      apartment, he saw the key of the door enveloped in crape.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sign, always respected, announced that the commander forbade
      absolutely and to all the entrance to his chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the Moor inspired such interest that Father Elzear, although
      well-nigh convinced of the futility of his effort, desired to make one
      last trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the commander&rsquo;s chamber.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. THE COMMANDER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The spectacle which met the eyes of Father Elzear was both frightful and
      solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chamber, which was very small, and lighted only by two narrow windows,
      was hung with black.
    </p>
    <p>
      A coffin of white wood, filled with ashes, and fastened to the floor by
      screws, served as a bed for Commander Pierre des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above this funereal bed was suspended the portrait of a young man wearing
      a cuirass, and leaning on a helmet. An aquiline nose, a delicate and
      gracefully chiselled mouth, and large, sea-green eyes gave to this face an
      expression which was, at the same time, proud and benevolent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the frame, on a tablet, was written distinctly the date December
      25,1613; a black curtain hanging near the picture could be drawn over it
      at pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons of war, attached to a rack, constituted the sole ornaments of this
      gruesome habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez had not observed the entrance of his brother. On his
      knees before his praying-desk, the commander was half covered with a
      coarse haircloth, which he wore night and day; his shoulders were bare. By
      the drops of coagulated blood, and by the furrows which veined his flesh,
      it could be seen that he had just inflicted upon himself a bloody
      discipline. His bowed head rested on his two hands, and now and then
      convulsive shudders shook his lacerated shoulders, as if his breast heaved
      under the agony of suppressed sobs. The praying-desk, where he was
      kneeling, was placed below the two small windows, which admitted an
      occasional and doubtful light into this chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this dim light the pale face and long white vestments of
      Father Elzear contrasted strangely with the wainscoting hung with black;
      he looked like a spectre. He stood there as if petrified; he had never
      believed his brother capable of such mortifications, and, lifting his
      hands to Heaven, he uttered a profound sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander started. He turned around quickly, and, seeing in the shadow
      the immovable figure of Father Elzear, cried, in terror:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a spirit? Do you come to ask account of the blood I have shed?&rdquo;
       His countenance was frightful. Never remorse, never despair, never terror
      impressed its seal more terribly upon the brow of guilt!
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, red with weeping, were fixed and haggard; his gray, closely
      shaven hair seemed to bristle upon his brow; his bluish lips trembled with
      fear, and his scraggy, muscular arms were extended before him as if they
      entreated a supernatural vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother! my brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Elzear, throwing himself upon the
      commander. &ldquo;My brother, it is I; may God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez stared at the good brother as if he did not recognise
      him; then, sinking down before his praying-desk, he let his head fall on
      his breast, and cried, in a hollow voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord is never with a murderer, and yet,&rdquo; added he, raising his head
      half-way and looking at the portrait in terror, &ldquo;and yet, to expiate my
      crime, I have placed the face of my victim always under my eyes! There, on
      my bed of ashes, where I seek a repose which flies from me, at every hour
      of the day, at every hour of the night, I behold the unrelenting face of
      him who says to me unceasingly, &lsquo;Murderer! Murderer! You have shed my
      blood! Be accursed!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother, oh, my brother, come back to your senses,&rdquo; whispered the
      father. He feared the voice of the commander might be heard outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without replying to his brother, the commander withdrew himself from his
      arms, rose to the full height of his tall stature, and approached the
      portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For twenty years there has not passed a day in which I have not wept my
      crime! For twenty years have I not tried to expiate this murder by the
      most cruel austerities? What more do you wish, infernal memory? What more
      do you ask? You, also,&mdash;you, my victim, have you not shed blood,&mdash;the
      blood of my accomplice? But alas! alas! this blood, you could shed it,
      you,&mdash;vengeance gave you the right, while I am the infamous assassin!
      Oh, yes, vengeance is just! Strike, strike, then, without pity! Soon the
      hand of God will strike me eternally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Overcome by emotion, the commander, almost deprived of consciousness,
      again fell on his knees, half recumbent upon the coffin which served him
      as bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear had never discovered his brother&rsquo;s secret. He knew him to be
      a prey to profound melancholy, but was ignorant of the cause, and now was
      frightened and distressed at the dreadful confidence betrayed in a moment
      of involuntary excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Pierre des Anbiez, a man of iron character, of invincible courage,
      should fall into such remorseful melancholy and weakness and despair,
      argued a cause that was terrible indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The intrepidity of the commander was proverbial; in the midst of the most
      frightful perils, his cool daring had been the wonder of all who beheld
      it. His gloomy impassibility had never forsaken him before, even amid the
      awful combats a seaman is compelled to wage with the elements. His courage
      approached ferocity. Once engaged in battle, once in the thick of the
      fight, he never gave quarter to the pirates. But this fever of massacre
      ceased when the battle-cries of the combatants and the sight of the blood
      excited him no longer. Then he became calm and humane, although pitiless
      toward the least fault of discipline. He had sustained the most brilliant
      engagements with Barbary pirates. His black galley was tie terror as well
      as the constant aim of attack among the pirates, but, thanks to the
      superiority of equipment, <i>Our Lady of Seven Sorrows</i> had never been
      captured, and her defeats had cost the enemy dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear, seated on the edge of the coffin, sustained the head of his
      brother on his knees. The commander, as pale as a ghost, lay unconscious,
      his brow wet with a cold sweat At last he regained his consciousness, and
      looked around him with a sad and astonished air; then, throwing a glance
      upon his arms and naked shoulders, scarcely covered by the haircloth, he
      asked the priest, abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you here, Elzear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although there was crape on your door, Pierre, I thought I could enter.
      The matter which brought me to you is a very important one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of keen dissatisfaction was depicted on the commander&rsquo;s
      countenance, as he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have been talking, no doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord has been moved to pity by your words, but I have not understood
      them, my brother. Besides, your mind was distracted; you were under the
      domination of some fatal illusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre smiled bitterly. &ldquo;Yes, it was an illusion,&mdash;a dream,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;You know, I am sometimes overcome by dreadful imaginations, and become
      delirious,&mdash;that is why I wish to be alone in these periods of
      madness. Believe me, Elzear, then the presence of any human being is
      intolerable to me, for I fear even you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, the commander entered a closet adjoining his
      chamber, and soon came out dressed in a long robe of black woollen cloth,
      on which was quartered the white cross of his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure of Pierre des Anbiez was tall, erect, and robust. His thin,
      nervous limbs showed, in spite of age, an uncommon vigour. His features
      were severe and warlike; thick, black eyebrows shaded his deep-set,
      hollow, burning eyes, which seemed always to glow with the sombre fire of
      a fever; a deep scar divided his brow, and furrowed his cheek until it was
      lost in his gray, short, and bushy beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to his chamber, he walked back and forth, his hands crossed
      behind his back, without saying a word to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he paused and extended to the priest his hand, which had been
      painfully torn by a gunshot, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sign which I had attached to my door ought to have assured my
      solitude. From the first officer to the last soldier on my galley, no one
      dares enter here after seeing that sign. I thought myself alone, as much
      alone as in the depth of a cloister, or the most hidden cell of the great
      penitentiary of our order. So, my brother, although you have seen,
      although you have heard, permit me to ask you never to say a word on this
      subject. Let what has passed here be forgotten,&mdash;as sacred as a
      confession made by a dying man under the seal of the confessional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be as you desire, Pierre,&rdquo; replied Father Elzear, sadly. &ldquo;I
      think of it only with pain that I cannot help you in the sorrows which
      have burdened you so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reassure yourself. It is not given to the power of man to console me,&rdquo;
       replied the commander. Then, as if he feared to wound the affection of his
      brother, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet your fraternal friendship and that of Raimond Digiare very dear to
      me; but, alas, although the dews of May and the sweet rains of June may
      fall in the sea, they can never sweeten the bitterness of its deep waters.
      But what did you come to ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon for a poor Moor condemned this morning to the chase-gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sentence has been executed, and it could not be, my brother, that I
      should ever grant you this pardon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank God, the sentence has not been
      executed; there is still some hope left me, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hour-glass stands at two. I gave order to the captain of the mast to
      tie the Moor to the chase-gun at one o&rsquo;clock; the slave ought to be now in
      the hands of the surgeon and chaplain,&mdash;may God save the soul of this
      pagan, if his body has not been able to endure the punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my earnest request, the captain of the mast suspended the execution,
      my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot say what is not true, Elzear, but this moment you have made a
      fatal gift to the captain of the mast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre, remember that I alone am responsible. Pardon, I pray&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Cross!&rdquo; cried the commander, impetuously, &ldquo;for the first time since
      I have commanded this galley, shall I pardon, in the same day, two of the
      gravest faults that can be committed: the revolt of a slave against a
      subordinate officer, and the want of discipline in the subordinate officer
      toward his chief? No, no, that is impossible!&rdquo; The commander took a
      whistle from his belt and blew a shrill note through the little silver
      tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      A page clothed in black appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain of the mast!&rdquo; said the commander, abruptly. The page went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my brother, will you be altogether without pity?&rdquo; cried Elzear, in a
      tone of sad reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without pity?&rdquo; and the commander smiled bitterly, &ldquo;yes, without pity for
      the faults of others, as for my own faults.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, remembering the terrible chastisement that his brother had
      just inflicted upon himself, realised that such a man must be inexorable
      in the observance of discipline, and bowed his head, renouncing all hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the mast entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remain eight nights in irons on the rambade,&rdquo; said the
      commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor bowed respectfully, without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the chaplain and surgeon be informed that the Moor is to be chastised
      on the chase-gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the mast bowed more profoundly still and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, at least, will not abandon this poor wretch!&rdquo; cried Father Elzear,
      rising hurriedly in order to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good brother went out, and Pierre des Anbiez resumed his slow
      promenade in his chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time his eyes were attracted, in spite of himself, by the
      fatal portrait of the man for whose murder he suffered such remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his steps became irregular and his face became sad and gloomy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time perhaps in many years, he felt a thrill of pain at the
      thought of the cruel suffering the Moor was about to undergo.
    </p>
    <p>
      This punishment was just and deserved, but he remembered that the unhappy
      captive had been, up to that time, gentle, submissive, and industrious.
      Yet such was the inflexibility of his character that he reproached himself
      for this involuntary pity, as a culpable weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the solemn flourishes of the trumpets of the galley announced that
      the execution was finished. He heard the slow and regular step of the
      soldiers and sailors, who were breaking ranks after having assisted at the
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Father Elzear entered, pale, dismayed, his eyes bathed in tears, and
      his cassock stained with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my brother! my brother! if you assisted at these executions, never in
      your life could you have the heart to order them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Moor?&rdquo; asked the commander, without replying otherwise to his
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I held his poor hands in mine; he endured the first blows with heroic
      resignation, closing his eyes to arrest the tears, and saying nothing but,
      &lsquo;My good father, do not abandon me&rsquo;. But when the pain became intolerable,
      when the blood began to gush out under the thongs, the unhappy man seemed
      to concentrate all his powers upon one thought, which might give him
      courage to endure this martyrdom. His face took on an expression of
      painful ecstasy; then he seemed to conquer pain, even to defy it, and
      cried, with an accent which came from the very depths of his paternal
      heart, &lsquo;My son! my son! Acoub, my beloved child!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he told of the punishment and last words of the Moor, Father Elzear
      could no longer restrain his tears; he wept as he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Pierre, if you had heard him&mdash;if you only knew with what
      passionate feeling he uttered those words, &lsquo;My son! my beloved child,&rsquo; you
      would have had pity on this poor father, whom they have carried off in a
      state of unconsciousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was the astonishment of Father Elzear, when he saw the commander,
      overwhelmed with emotion, hide his head in his hands and cry, sobbing
      convulsively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son! a son! I, too, have a son!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE POLACRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the execution of the sentence on the Moor, the north wind
      was blowing with increasing violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waves hurled themselves with fury against the girdle of rocks through
      which opened the narrow passage which led into the road of Tolari.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Captain Simon, mounted on the
      platform of the rambade, was talking with Captain Hugues about the
      punishment which occurred the day before, and of the courage of the Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly they saw a polacre, her sails almost torn away, flying before the
      tempest with the rapidity of an arrow, and about to enter the dangerous
      pass of which we have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the frail vessel, rising on the crest of the towering waves,
      would show the edge of her keel running with foam like the breast of a
      race-horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, sinking in the hollow of the waves, she would plunge with such
      violence that her stem would be almost perpendicular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they could distinguish on the deluged deck two men enveloped in brown
      mantles with hoods, who were employing every possible effort to hold the
      whip-staff of the rudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five other sailors, squatting at the prow, or holding on to the rigging,
      awaited the moment to aid in the manoeuvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, by turns carried to the top of the waves and plunged in their depths,
      the polacre was hastening with frightful speed to tie narrow entrance of
      the channel, where the waves were dashing with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Elmo!&rdquo; cried Captain Simon, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a ship gone to destruction!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is lost,&rdquo; replied Hugues, coldly; &ldquo;in a few minutes her rigging and
      hull will be nothing but a wreck, and her sailors will be corpses. May the
      Lord save the souls of our brothers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he dare venture in this passage at such a time?&rdquo; said the gunner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a man is to be shipwrecked it is better to perish with a feeble hope.
      When a man hopes, he prays, and dies a Christian; when he despairs, he
      blasphemes, and dies a pagan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, look, Simon, there is the little boat going into the breakers; it
      is all up with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the commander, who had been informed of the approach of the
      vessel and of her desperate condition, appeared on deck with all the
      chevaliers, officers, and others who manned the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      After carefully examining the polacre and the breakers, Pierre des Anbiez
      called out, in a loud and solemn voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the two long-boats be ready and equipped to gather the corpses on the
      beach: no human power can save this unfortunate ship. Only God can help
      her.&rdquo; While the overseers superintended the execution of this order, the
      commander, turning to the chaplain, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother, let us say the prayers for the dying, for these unfortunate
      men. Brothers, on your knees. Let the crew uncover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a grand and imposing spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the chevaliers, clothed in black, were kneeling bareheaded on the
      deck; the bell for prayer dolefully tolled a funeral knell amid the wild
      shrieks of the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slaves were also on their knees and uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rear, in the middle of a group of chevaliers dressed in black,
      Father Elzear in his white cassock could be distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prayers for the dying were said with as much solemnity as if they were
      being recited in a church on land, or in a cloister.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a mere form; these monk-soldiers were sad and contemplative. As
      sailors they saw a vessel without hope; as Christians they prayed for the
      souls of their brothers. In fact the polacre seemed in danger of going
      down every moment. The furious waves, rushing into the channel on their
      way to the sea, broke the current and whirled and tossed in every
      direction. Her sails, by which she might have made steady headway, were
      blown under the enormous rocks; her rudder was useless, and she was at the
      mercy of the wind and waters which rushed back and forth in unabating
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prayers and chants continued without cessation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all the other voices could be heard the manly, sonorous voice of the
      commander. The slaves on their knees looked in sullen apathy on this
      desperate struggle of man against the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, by an unhoped-for chance, either because the polacre was of such
      perfect construction, or because she responded finally to the action of
      her rudder, or because the little triangular sail that she hoisted caught
      some current of the upper air, the gallant little vessel steadied herself,
      resumed her headway, and cleared the dangerous passage with the rapidity
      and lightness of a sea-gull.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes after she was out of danger, calmly sailing the waters of
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manoeuvre was so unforeseen, so wonderful, and so well executed, that
      for a moment astonishment suspended the prayers of the chevaliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander, amazed, said to the officers, after a few moments of
      breathless silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brothers, let us thank the Lord for having heard our prayers, and let
      us sing a song of thanksgiving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the galley resounded with this pious and solemn invocation, the
      polacre, <i>The Holy Terror to the Moors</i>, for it was she, was beating
      about in the road with very little sail, in order to approach the black
      galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was but a little distance from her when a cannon-shot, sent from the
      rambade of <i>Our Lady of Seven Sorrows</i>, signalled her to hoist her
      flag and lie to.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second cannon-shot ordered her to send her captain on board the black
      galley. Whatever interest this vessel inspired in the commander when she
      was in danger, her perils past, she must conform to the established rules
      for visiting ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the polacre lay to, and her little boat, equipped with two rowers and
      steered by a third sailor, approached the stem of the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who was at the helm left the whip-staff, slowly climbed the stairs
      of the first seat of rowers, and stood before the commander and his
      chevaliers, who had gathered together in the rear of the galley. The
      sailor in question was no other than our old acquaintance, the worthy
      Luquin Trinquetaille. His hooded mantle, his boots, and his breeches of
      coarse wool were running with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he set foot on the deck of the galley he respectfully allowed his hood
      to fall back on his shoulders, and it could be easily seen that his good,
      honest face was still excited by the terrible experience through which he
      had just passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander, in his visits to Maison-Forte, had often seen Luquin, and
      was agreeably surprised to recognise a man who could give him some news of
      his brother, Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord has rescued your ship from a great peril,&rdquo; said the commander to
      him. &ldquo;We have already prayed for your soul, and the souls of your
      companions.&lsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May all of you be blessed, M. Commander; we had need of it, for our
      situation was awful; never since I have been at sea did I ever take part
      in such a frolic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commander replied to the captain, sternly, &ldquo;The trials that the Lord
      sends us are not frolics. How is my brother Raimond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur is well,&rdquo; replied Trinquetaille, a little ashamed of having
      been reproved by the commander. &ldquo;I left him in good health, day before
      yesterday, when I left Maison-Forte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is Mlle, des Anbiez?&rdquo; asked Father Elzear, who had come near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mlle, des Anbiez is very well, father,&rdquo; replied Luquin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you sail from, and where are you going?&rdquo; asked the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Commander, yesterday I came out of La Ciotat, with three
      fishing-boats, all armed, in order to cruise two or three leagues from the
      coasts to discover the pirates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pirates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. Commander. A pirate chebec appeared three days ago; Master Peyrou
      discovered it. All the coast is alarmed; they expect a descent from the
      pirates, and they are right, because a tartan from Nice, that I met before
      this squall, told me that on the east of Corsica had been seen three
      vessels, and one of them is the <i>Red Galleon</i> of Pog-Reis, the
      renegade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis!&rdquo; exclaimed the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis!&rdquo; repeated the chevaliers, who surrounded the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis!&rdquo; again said Pierre des Anbiez, with an expression of savage
      satisfaction, as if at last he was about to meet an implacable enemy he
      had long sought, but who, by some fatality, had always escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you going to do at Tolari?&rdquo; asked the commander of
      Trinquetaille.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak truly, M. Commander, I was not going for pleasure. Surprised by
      the squall yesterday, I was beating about as I could, but the weather
      became so violent, and thinking my polacre doomed, I made a vow to Our
      Lady of Protection, and risked entering the pass, that I was acquainted
      with, for I have anchored there many a time, coming from the coasts of
      Sardinia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord grant that this north wind may stop blowing!&rdquo; said the
      commander; then, addressing his expert pilot, he said, &ldquo;What do you think
      of the weather, pilot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Commander, if the wind increases until sunset, there is a chance that
      it will cease at the rising of the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is so, and you can put out to-night without danger,&rdquo; said the
      commander to Trinquetaille, &ldquo;go to La Ciotat and inform my brother of my
      arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that will be a great joy to Maison-Forte, M. commander, although your
      arrival there may be useless, for a vessel from Marseilles, that I met,
      told me that soldiers had been sent to La Ciotat with the captain of the
      company of the guards attending the Marshal of Vitry. They said that these
      troops were to be sent to Maison-Forte, in consequence of the affair of
      the recorder Isnard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked the commander of Luquin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain then told how Raimond V., instead of submitting to the orders
      of the Governor of Provence, had had his emissary chased by bulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he listened to the narration of this imprudent pleasantry on the part
      of Raimond V., the commander and Father Elzear looked at each other sadly,
      as if they deplored the foolish and rash conduct of their brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go below to the refectory, and the head waiter will give you something to
      warm and strengthen you,&rdquo; said the commander to Luquin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain obeyed this order with gratitude, and returned to the prow,
      followed by a few curious sailors, anxious to learn all the news of
      Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander entered his chamber with his brother, and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as the weather will permit, we will depart for Maison-Forte. I
      fear much that Raimond may be the victim of his rashness concerning the
      creatures of the cardinal. The Lord grant that I may meet Pog-Reis, and
      that I may be able to prevent the evil which he is no doubt preparing for
      this shore, which is so defenceless, and for the unfortunate city of La
      Ciotat.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. THE RED GALLEON AND THE SYBARITE
    </h2>
    <p>
      About the same time that <i>The Holy Terror to the Moors</i> was making
      her marvellous entrance into the road of Tolari, and the sad and black
      galley of Malta was standing toward her, three vessels of very different
      character were anchored in Port Mage, quite a good road situated on the
      northeast of the island of Port-Cros, one of the smallest of the Hyères
      islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Port-Cros, about six or seven leagues from La Ciotat, was at this time of
      year thickly populated, inasmuch as the season for tunnies and sardines
      brought many fishermen there who made it a temporary home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two galleys and a chebec were at anchor in the bay of which we speak. The
      tempest had not diminished in violence, but the waters of Port Mage,
      protected by the high lands on the northwest side, were very tranquil, and
      reflected in their calm azure the brilliant colours which shone from the
      <i>Red Galleon</i> of Pog-Reis and the green galley of Trimalcyon. The
      chebec, commanded by Erebus, had nothing remarkable in its exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fears of the watchman and the suspicions of Reine were only too well
      founded. The three unknown men of the gorges of Ollioules were no other
      than pirate captains, not natives of Barbary, but renegades.
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of their cruises, they got possession of a Holland vessel, and
      found on board a Muscovite lord, his son, and preceptor. After having sold
      them as slaves in Algiers, they took their papers and had the audacity to
      disembark at Cette, and, coming to Marseilles by land, to present
      themselves to the Marshal of Vitry under borrowed names. The marshal,
      deceived by the very boldness of this artifice, received them hospitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a sojourn quite profitably employed in making inquiries concerning
      the departures and arrivals of vessels of commerce, the three corsairs
      returned to Cette, and at that point were not distant from the coast of
      Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They contemplated an important attack on this seashore, and had been
      keeping themselves sometimes in one of the numerous bays of the island of
      Corsica, and sometimes in one of the little deserted harbours on the
      coasts of France or of Savoy; for, at this period, the shores were so
      badly guarded that pirates risked such positions without fear, and too
      often without danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was as much difference in the aspect of the two pirate galleys of
      which we speak, and that of the commander, as there could be between a
      solemnly attired nun and a silly Bohemian girl glittering in satin and
      spangles. One was as silent and somber as the others were gay and
      blustering.
    </p>
    <p>
      We prefer to conduct the reader on board the <i>Sybarite</i>, a galley of
      twenty-six oars commanded by Trimalcyon, and anchored a few cable lengths
      from the <i>Red Galleon</i> of Pog-Reis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of the pirate galleys resembled very much that of the
      galleys of Malta; but the ornamentation and splendour of the furniture and
      accommodation inside differed greatly from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew was composed of slaves, whether Christians, negroes, or even
      Turks, as the renegades took little pains as to the manner of recruiting
      the service of their vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they were chained to their benches, as were the crews on the
      galleys of Malta, the slaves of the <i>Sybarite</i> seemed to partake of
      the joyous atmosphere which surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of having a ferocious, morose, or dejected air, their countenances
      expressed a vulgar indifference or a cynical insolence. They appeared
      robust and capable of enduring the severest fatigue, but the fear inspired
      by their undisciplined character could be seen in the heroic appointments
      of repression which surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two pieces of ordnance and several blunderbusses on pivot, constantly
      turned on the crew, were disposed in such a manner that they could sweep
      the galley from one end to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spahis, or select soldiers charged with superintending the crew,
      always wore long pistols in their belts, and carried a battle-axe in their
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uniform of these spahis consisted of red mantles, gaiters of
      embroidered morocco, and a coat of mail underneath a jacket which was
      trimmed with yellow lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their scarlet fez was surmounted by a turban of coarse white muslin,
      loosely rolled in the antique style which, it was said, ran back to the
      time of the soldiers of Hai-Keddin-Barberousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The costume of the crew was not uniform, as plunder and pillage were the
      principal means by which worn-out garments were replaced. Some of them
      wore breeches and doublets upon which could be seen the marks of the gold
      or silver lace which had once adorned them, and which had been removed for
      the profit of the <i>reis</i> or the captain. Others were clothed in the
      coats of soldiers, and some even wore the black felt garments taken from
      the soldiers of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the heterogeneous appearance of the crew, the galley of
      Trimalcyon-Reis was kept with scrupulous cleanliness. Its sea-green
      colour, relieved with fillets of purple, was, at the stern, richly set off
      in gold, and, in fact, a red flag, on which was embroidered in white the
      two-edged scimitar, called Zulfekar, was the only sign by which the <i>Sybarite</i>
      could be recognised as a pirate vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far distant lay at anchor the <i>Red Galleon</i> of Pog-Reis, which
      had a severer and more warlike appearance, and near the entrance of the
      bay the <i>Tsekedery</i>, or light vessel commanded by Erebus, carried the
      same standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coasts of France were then, as we have said, in such a deplorable
      state of defence that these three vessels had been able, without the
      slightest obstacle, to put into port, in order to escape the storm which
      raged the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the exterior of the <i>Sybarite</i> was splendid, her interior offered
      all the refinements of the most elaborate luxury, in which there was a
      happy combination of the customs of the West and the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dwarf negro, fantastically attired, had just struck three resounding
      blows on a Chinese gong placed at the stem near the helm. At this signal a
      band of musical instruments performed some martial airs. It was the
      dinner-hour of Trimalcyon, and the chamber of the stem had been converted
      temporarily into a dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partitions were hidden under rich tapestries of poppy-coloured
      Venetian brocatelle with handsome designs in green and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog and Trimalcyon were seated at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon had the same characteristic corpulence, the same bright
      complexion, shrewd eye, joyous countenance, and red, sensual lips. His
      long, soft cloak of blue velvet disclosed, in opening, a buff-skin of
      extreme elasticity, covered over with a steel net so finely wrought that
      it was as flexible as the thinnest material. This habit of wearing
      continually a defensive armour proved in what confident security the
      captain of the <i>Sybarite</i> was accustomed to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog-Reis, sitting opposite his companion, had also the same haughty,
      sarcastic manner. He wore an Arabian yellek of black velvet embroidered
      with black silk, on which hung at full length his heavy red beard; his
      green and red cap of the Albanian fashion covered half his white forehead,
      which was deeply furrowed with wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two female slaves of great beauty, one a mulattress, the other a
      Circassian, dressed in light, thin gowns of Smyrna material, performed,
      with the aid of the dwarf negro, the table service of Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On revolving shelves were displayed magnificent pieces of plate, unmatched
      and incomplete it is true, but of the most beautiful workmanship, some of
      silver, some of gilt, and others of gold set with precious stones. In the
      midst of this plate, the fruit of robbery and murder, were placed, in
      sacrilegious derision, sacred vessels, carried away either from the
      churches on the seashore or from Christian ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very penetrating and very sweet perfume burned in a censer hanging from
      one of the rafters of the ceiling. Seated on a luxurious divan, the
      captain of the <i>Sybarite</i> said to his guest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse this poor hospitality, my comrade. I would prefer to replace these
      poor girls with Egyptian slaves, who, equipped with ewers of Corinthian
      metal, would sprinkle, as they sang, rose-scented snow-water on our
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not lack vases and ewers, Trimalcyon,&rdquo; said Pog, throwing a
      significant glance at the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, yes, there are vases of gold and silver, but what is that
      compared to the Corinthian metal of which antiquity speaks: a metal made
      of a mixture of gold, silver, and bronze, and so marvellously wrought that
      a large ewer and basin only weighed one pound? By Sardanapalus! comrade,
      some day I must make a descent on Messina. They say that the viceroy
      possesses several antique statuettes of that precious metal. But take some
      of this partridge pudding spiced with wild aniseed; I had it served on its
      silver gridiron burning hot. Or do you prefer these imitations of pea-fowl
      eggs? You will find there, instead of the yellow, a very fat tit-lark,
      well yellowed, and, instead of the white, a thick sauce of cooked cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your fine vocabulary of gormandising ought to win for you the esteem of
      your cook. You appear to me to be made, both of you, for the purpose of
      understanding each other,&rdquo; said Pog, eating with disdainful indifference
      the delicate dishes served by his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cook,&rdquo; replied Trimalcyon, &ldquo;understands me well enough, in fact,
      although sometimes he has his discouragements; he regrets France, from
      which country I carried him off unawares. I have tried to console him, for
      a long time, with everything,&mdash;silver, money, attention,&mdash;nothing
      succeeds however, so I have finished where I ought to have begun, with a
      severe bastinado, and am quite well satisfied with it, and he is too, I
      suppose, since he cooks wonderfully, as you see. Give us something to
      drink, Orangine!&rdquo; called Trimalcyon to the mulattress, who poured out a
      glorious glass of Bordeaux wine. &ldquo;What is that wine, Crow-provender?&rdquo;
       asked he of the negro dwarf, holding his glass up to his eyes to judge its
      colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, it was taken, in the month of June, from a Bordeaux brigantine
      on its way to Genoa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, h&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon, tasting it, &ldquo;it is good, very good, but there
      is the inconvenience of supplying ourselves as we do, friend Pog: we never
      have the same quality, so if we get accustomed to one kind of wine, we
      meet with cruel disappointments. Ah! our trade is not a bed of roses. But
      you do not drink! Fill Seigneur Fog&rsquo;s glass, Swan-skin,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon,
      to the white Circassian, pointing to his guest&rsquo;s cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, as a refusal, placed his finger over his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, let us drink to the success of our descent upon La Ciotat,
      comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog replied to this new invitation by a movement of contemptuous
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, comrade,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon, without the slightest
      indication of being offended by the refusal and haughty manner of his
      guest, &ldquo;it is just as well not to trust myself to your invocations; the
      devil knows your voice, and he always thinks you are calling him. But you
      are wrong to disdain that ham, it is from Westphalia, I think,&mdash;is it
      not, you scoundrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; said the dwarf, &ldquo;it came from that Dutch fly-boat,
      arrested as it sailed out of the strait of Sardinia. It was destined for
      the Viceroy of Naples.&rdquo; At that moment the flourishes of the musicians
      ceased; a noise, at first quite indistinct, but increasing by degrees,
      soon became loud and threatening. The clanking of chains and complaints of
      the galley-slaves could be heard, and, finally, rising above the tumult,
      the voices of the spahis and the cracking of the coxswain&rsquo;s whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon seemed so accustomed to these cries, that he continued to drink
      a glass of wine that he was carrying to his lips, and carelessly remarked,
      as he set his glass on the table:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some dogs that want to bite; fortunately their chains are good
      and strong. Crow-provender, go and see why the musicians have stopped
      playing. I will have them given twenty blows of the cowhide if they stop
      again, instead of blowing their trumpets. I am too good. I love the arts
      too much. Instead of selling these do-nothings in Algiers, I have kept
      them to make music, and that is the way they behave! Ah! if they were not
      too feeble for the crew, they should find out what it is to handle the
      oar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are certainly too weak for that, my lord,&rdquo; said the negro dwarf;
      &ldquo;the comedians that you captured with them on that galley from Barcelona
      are still at the house of Jousouf, who bought them. He cannot get two
      pieces of gold for a single one of the singing, blowing cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog-Reis seemed thoughtful and oblivious of what was passing around him,
      although the murmurs of dissatisfaction increased to such violence that
      Trimalcyon said to the dwarf:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you go out, place here by me, on the divan, my pistols and a stock
      of arms. Well, now go and see what is the matter. If it is anything
      serious, let Mello come and tell me. At the same time, inform those
      blowers of trumpets that I will make them swallow trumpets and buccinæ if
      they stop playing a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, they say they have not wind enough to play two hours together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, they lack wind, do they! Ah, well, tell them that if they give me
      that reason again I will have their stomachs opened, and by means of a
      blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows put them in such a condition that they will not lack
      wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this coarse and brutal pleasantry, Orangine and Swan-skin looked at
      each other in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell them besides,&rdquo; added Trimalcyon, &ldquo;that as they are not worth
      one piece of gold in the slave market, and as it costs me more to keep
      them than they are worth, I shall think nothing of gratifying my caprice
      on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I like in you,&rdquo; said Pog, slowly, as he awakened from his reverie,
      &ldquo;is that you are a stranger to every sentiment, I will not say of virtue,
      but of humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what in the devil do you say that to me for, friend Pog? You see
      that, as inhuman as I am, I do not forget who you are, and who I am. You
      say &lsquo;tu&rsquo; to me, and I answer &lsquo;vous&rsquo; to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then two shots were fired and resounded through the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil! there is Mello who is also saying &lsquo;tue,&rsquo;&rdquo; added Trimalcyon,
      smiling at his odious play upon words and looking toward the door with
      imperturbable calmness. The two women slaves fell on their knees with
      signs of agonising terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the trumpets burst forth with an energy which doubtless violated
      all the laws of harmony, but which proved at least that the threats
      conveyed by the negro dwarf had taken effect, and that the unhappy
      musicians believed Trimalcyon capable of torturing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two more shots, there was a cry,&mdash;a terrible roar uttered by
      all the slaves at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult was then succeeded by a profound silence. &ldquo;It seems it was
      nothing after all,&rdquo; said the captain of the <i>Sybarite</i>, addressing
      Pog, who had again fallen into a reverie. &ldquo;But tell me, comrade,&rdquo;
       continued he, &ldquo;in what do you discover that I have nothing human in me? I
      love the arts, and letters and luxury. I plunder with discretion, taking
      only what suits me. I enjoy to the utmost all of the five senses with
      which I am provided. I fight with care, preferring to attack one who is
      weaker rather than one who is stronger than myself, and my commerce
      consists in taking from those who have with the least possible chance of
      loss. Yes, once again I ask you, comrade, where in the devil do you see
      inhumanity in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you excite my shame as well as my pity. You have not even the
      energy of evil. There is always in you the pedantry of the college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, fie upon you, my comrade; do not talk of the college, of that sad
      time of meagre cheer and privations without number. I would be at this
      moment as dry as a galley mast, if I had continued spitting Latin, while
      now,&rdquo; said the insolent knave, striking his stomach, &ldquo;I have the rotundity
      of a prebendary; and all that, thanks to whom? To Yacoub-Reis, who, twenty
      years ago, made me a slave as I was going by sea to Civita-Vecchia, to try
      my clerical fortune in the city of the clergy. Yacoub-Reis gave me mind,
      activity, and courage. I was young, he taught me his trade. I renounced my
      religion, I took the turban, and so from one thing to another, from
      pillage to murder, I came at last to be commander of the <i>Sybarite</i>.
      Commerce goes well! I expose myself in extreme cases, and when it is
      necessary I fight like another, but I take care of my skin, it is true,
      because I intend before long to retire from business, and repose from the
      fatigues of war in my retreat in Tripoli, with several Madames Trimalcyon.
      Again I ask, is not all that very human?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words appeared to make little impression on the silent companion of
      the captain of the <i>Sybarite</i>, who contented himself with saying,
      with a shrug of the shoulders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wild boar to his lair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sardanapalus! speaking of wild boars, how I would like to have those that
      figured in the epic feasts of Trimalcyon, my patron!&rdquo; cried the unmannerly
      boor, without appearing to take offence at the contempt of his guest.
      &ldquo;Those were worthy wild boars, that they served whole with caps on their
      heads, and insides stuffed with puddings and sausages imitating the
      entrails, or perhaps enclosing winged thrushes that would fly up to the
      ceiling. Those are luxuries I shall realise some day or other.
      Sardanapalus! I have worked twenty years just to give myself some day a
      feast worthy of Roman antiquity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro dwarf opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirate then thought only of the tumult which had so suddenly ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, rascal, what about that noise? Why did not Mello come? Was it,
      then, nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord, a Christian quarrelled with an Albanian slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Albanian stabbed the Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Christians cried &lsquo;Death to the Albanian,&rsquo; but the Christian who was
      wounded knocked the Albanian down and almost killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Albanians and the Moors, in their turn, roared against the
      Christians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prevent the crew killing each other, and to satisfy everybody, patron
      Mello blew the wounded Christian&rsquo;s and the wounded Albanian&rsquo;s brains out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, seeing that, everybody became quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the musicians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I spoke to them about the blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows, and before I had
      finished my sentence, they blew so hard on their trumpets and shells, I
      became almost deaf. I was about to forget, my lord, that Mello signalled
      the long-boat of Seigneur Erebus, who is coming now to the galley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon cried, &ldquo;Quick, Swan-skin, Orangine, a cover for the most
      beautiful youth who ever captured poor merchant ships.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI. POG AND EREBUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before continuing this narrative, some explanation is necessary concerning
      Erebus and Seigneur Pog, the silent and sarcastic man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1612, twenty years before the period of which we write, a
      Frenchman, still young, arrived at Tripoli, with one servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the vessel which brought him to Tripoli had frequent
      opportunity to observe that his passenger was very expert in matters
      pertaining to navigation; he concluded finally that the traveller was an
      officer on the vessels and galleys of the king, and he was not mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seigneur Pog&mdash;we continue to give him this assumed name&mdash;was an
      excellent sailor, as we shall soon see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his arrival at Tripoli, Pog, after having, according to the custom of
      Barbary, bought the protection of Bey Hassan, hired a house in the suburbs
      of the city, not far from the sea. He lived there during one year with his
      valet in profound solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some French merchants, established at Tripoli, exhausted their powers of
      conjecture on the singular taste of their compatriot, who came, as they
      thought, through mere caprice, to inhabit a wild and deserted coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some attributed this eccentricity to a violent, desperate grief; others
      saw, if not an unpardonable folly, a monomania, at least, in his strange
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      These last suppositions did not lack foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At certain periods of the year, Pog, it was said, was subject to such
      attacks of despair and rage that belated herdsmen, passing his solitary
      house at night, would hear furious and frantic cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four years passed in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      To distract his mind from gloomy thoughts, and to recuperate his health,
      Pog made long voyages at sea in a small vessel, but a very smooth and
      swift-sailing ship which he himself managed with rare skill. His crew
      consisted of two young slave Moors.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, one of the most famous and cruel corsairs of Tripoli, named
      Kemal-Reis, came near perishing with his galley, which ran aground on the
      Coast a short distance from the house of Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog was just returning from one of his voyages. Recognising the galley of
      Kemal-Reis, he set sail toward her, and rendered her the most efficient
      aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Pog&rsquo;s slaves reported later that he had heard him say, &ldquo;Man would
      be too happy if all the wolves and tigers were destroyed.&rdquo; So the saving
      of Kemal-Reis, dreaded for reason of his cruelties, was due to the bitter
      misanthropy of Pog. Instead of yielding to an impulse of natural
      generosity, he desired to preserve to humanity one of its most terrible
      scourges.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after this event Kemal-Reis visited the isolated house of the
      Frenchman, and, by degrees, a sort of intimacy was established between the
      pirate and the misanthrope.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the newsmongers of Tripoli learned with astonishment that Pog had
      embarked on board the galley of Kemal-Reis. They supposed the Frenchman to
      be very rich, and that he had freighted the Tripolitan vessel in order to
      take a voyage of pleasure on the coast of Barbary and Egypt and Syria.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great astonishment of the public, Kemal-Reis returned a month after
      his departure, with his galley filled with French slaves, captured from
      the coasts of Languedoc and Provence, and the rumour was current in
      Tripoli that the favourable results of this audacious enter-prise were
      owing to the information and advice given by Pog, who knew better than any
      one else the weak points on the seashore of France. This rumour soon
      acquired such probability that our consul at Tripoli deemed it his duty to
      inform against Pog, and to instruct the ministers of Louis XIII. of what
      had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here we make the statement, once for all, that in 1610, as well as in
      1630 and in 1700, the abduction of inhabitants from our coasts by the
      regencies of Barbary was almost never considered a cause for a declaration
      of war against these powers. Our consuls assisted at the disembarking of
      the captives and generally acted as mediators for their ransom.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any measures were taken against Pog, it was because he had, as a
      Frenchman, assisted with his own hand in an attack upon his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information given by the consul was in vain, to the great scandal of
      our compatriots and of Europeans established at Tripoli. Pog made a solemn
      abjuration, renounced the cross, assumed the turban, and henceforth
      remained unmolested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kemal-Reis had everywhere proclaimed that the new renegade was one of the
      best captains whom he had ever known, and that the regency of Barbary
      could not have made a more useful acquisition. From that moment Pog-Reis
      equipped a galley and directed his operations solely against French
      vessels, and especially against the galleys of Malta, commanded by the
      chevaliers of our nation. Several times he ravaged the coasts of Languedoc
      and Provence with impunity. It must be said, however, that this fury for
      plunder and destruction only seized Pog, so to speak, periodically, and by
      paroxysms, and his rage seemed to reach its height about the end of the
      month of December.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that month he showed himself without pity, and it is related, with
      a shudder of horror, that several times he had the throats of a great
      number of captives cut,&mdash;a frightful and bloody holocaust which he
      offered, doubtless, on some painful and dreaded anniversary. The month of
      December passed, his mind, obscured by a bloodthirsty madness, became more
      calm, when, returning to Tripoli, and shutting himself up in his solitude,
      he remained sometimes two or three months without putting to sea. Then,
      his desperate soul again possessed by some bitter resentment, he equipped
      his galley anew, and recommenced his atrocious career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the French captives whom he had taken in his first expedition with
      Kemal-Reis, and whom he had generously abandoned to this corsair, upon the
      sole condition that liberty should never be restored to them, was one whom
      he retained,&mdash;a child of four or five years carried away from the
      coast of Languedoc, with an old woman who died during the passage. This
      child of unparagoned beauty was Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog named him thus, as if he wished by the fatal name to predestinate the
      unfortunate child to the career to which his evil designs devoted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intensity of his hatred of the human race, Pog had the infernal
      desire to destroy the soul of this unfortunate child, by giving him the
      most pernicious education. He devoted himself to this task with abominable
      perseverance. As Erebus advanced in years, Pog, without reason for his
      absurd eccentricities, alternately expended upon the boy a furious
      aversion and cruelty, and impulsive demonstrations of solicitude,&mdash;these
      last being the only sentiments af kindness he had felt for many years. By
      degrees, these spasmodic expressions of sympathy discontinued, and Pog
      soon included Erebus in the common execration with which he pursued
      mankind, and adhered to his fatal resolution with deadly persistence. Far
      from leaving the boy&rsquo;s mind uneducated, he took particular pains in
      developing it. Among the numerous slaves which his avocation of rapine
      brought in his way, Pog-Reis easily found professors and teachers of all
      sorts, and what he failed to find he purchased from other corsairs or
      obtained by other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, having learned that a celebrated Spanish painter, named Juan
      Pelieko, lived in Barcelona, he employed every stratagem to draw him out
      of the city, and at last succeeded in capturing him and taking him to
      Tripoli. When this artist had perfected Erebus in his art, Pog had him put
      in chains, in which servitude he remained until he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his impious and cruel course of experiment, Pog, desiring to force his
      victim through every degree in the scale of iniquity, from vice to crime,
      took pleasure in making the child acquainted with all kinds of sin, and in
      giving him opportunities for culture and accomplishments. He argued that
      with ordinary intelligence a man was only an ordinary villain, but that
      various resources enabled him to achieve the most wonderful results in
      audacious wickedness. Through this abominable system, the arts, instead of
      elevating the soul of Erebus, were designed to develop a passion for
      sensual pleasures, and to materialise an otherwise exalted nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wonders of painting and music do not lift the soul into the
      infinite realm of the ideal, when one seeks only a melody more or less
      agreeable to the ear, or a form more or less attractive to the eye, then
      the arts deprave rather than ennoble mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, Pog must have had a terrible vengeance to wreak upon humanity, his
      misanthropy must have partaken of the nature of madness, that he could
      have been guilty of the sacrilegious cruelty of thus degrading a pure
      young soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      No scruple or regret made him hesitate. As a tender father would seek to
      guard his child&rsquo;s mind from dangerous thoughts, and to encourage in his
      young heart all noble and generous instincts, Pog, on the other hand, left
      no means untried to corrupt this unhappy child, and to excite his bad
      passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is with certain moral organisations as with physical natures,&mdash;they
      can be injured and enfeebled, but not completely ruined, so healthy and
      vigorous is their vital germ. Thus it was with Erebus. By a special
      providence, the pernicious teachings of Pog had not yet, so to speak,
      essentially altered the heart of the poor boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singular instinct of contradiction peculiar to youth saved him from
      many dangers. The very facility with which he could, scarcely adolescent,
      have yielded to every excess, the odious temptations they dared set before
      him, sufficed to preserve him from precocious dissipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, the natural exaltation of his sentiments urged him to cultivate
      the sweet, pure, and noble emotions from which they endeavoured to remove
      him, but unfortunately the fatal influence of Pog had not been absolutely
      vain. The ardent character of Erebus retained a sad evidence of the
      perversity of his education.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in some moments he had passionate yearnings toward good, if he
      struggled against the detestable counsels of his tutor, the habit of a
      warlike and adventurous life which he had led from the age of twelve or
      thirteen years, the impetuosity of his character, and the transport of his
      passions, often dragged him into grievous excess. From his earliest youth,
      Pog had taken him along in the various incursions into the shore, and the
      courage and natural daring of Erebus had been valiantly exhibited in
      several combats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructed by experience and by practice, he had learned with great
      facility the avocation of sailor and mariner, and the constant aim of Pog
      had been to inculcate in him a profound and relentless hatred of the
      chevaliers of Malta, who were represented to him as the murderers of his
      family, and the secret of this murder Pog had faithfully promised to
      reveal to him some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet nothing was more false. Pog had no knowledge of the parents of the
      child, left an orphan at such an early age, but he wished to perpetuate in
      his victim his own hatred of the chevaliers of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus renewed his vows, and an ardent desire for vengeance developed in
      his young soul against the soldiers of Christ, whom he believed to be the
      murderers of his family. In other respects, Erebus gave less satisfaction
      to Pog. Cruelty in cold blood was revolting to him, and sometimes he was
      deeply moved at the sight of human suffering. Pog had often observed that
      irony and sarcasm were a powerful and infallible arm in combating the
      natural nobility of the youth&rsquo;s character, and by comparing him to a
      clergyman, or a tonsured Christian, or accusing him of weakness and
      cowardice, he often provoked the unhappy boy to culpable acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene in the rocks of Ollioules, where Erebus saw Reine for the first
      time, is a striking proof of that constant struggle between his natural
      inclinations and the bad passions that Pog excited in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first impulse of Erebus was to hasten to the rescue of Raimond V. and
      to respond with almost filial veneration to the old man&rsquo;s outburst of
      gratitude,&mdash;in fact, to believe himself rewarded for his generous
      conduct by the satisfaction of his conscience and the grateful looks of
      the young girl; but a bitter sarcasm from Pog, a coarse jest from
      Trimalcyon, changed these noble emotions into sensual desire and a
      profound disdain for the courageous action by which he had just honoured
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in spite of the cynical bantering of the two pirates, the enchanting
      beauty of Reine made a profound impression upon Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never loved, his heart had never taken part in the coarse pleasures
      which he had sought among the slaves that the hazard of war had thrown
      into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog and Trimalcyon were not long in perceiving a certain change in the
      character of Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some indiscreet words enlightened Pog as to the powerful influence of this
      first love upon the young man, and he began to fear the consequences of
      this passion, in elevating the heart of Erebus,&mdash;a love which would
      make the young man blush for the abominable life he was leading, and
      awaken in him the most generous sentiments. Pog, therefore resolved to
      kill this love by possession, and proposed to Erebus to abduct Reine by
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      He encountered a lively resistance in the young pirate. Erebus thought the
      proposed abduction atrocious; he wished to be loved or to make himself
      loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog then suggested another plan. He flattered the self-love of Erebus
      beyond measure, by proving to him that he must have made a profound
      impression on the heart of the young girl, but that it was necessary, by
      mysterious means, to preserve and increase the remembrance that she would
      necessarily hide from the knowledge of her father. Then, when he was sure
      of being loved, he was to appear, offer to carry her away, and withdraw if
      she did not accept his proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan, which Pog intended to modify at its conclusion, satisfied
      Erebus. We have seen how it was partly executed at Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Moor who had accompanied the young pirate at sea from his childhood, and
      who was warmly attached to him, was to introduce himself secretly into the
      castle of Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man was the Bohemian whom we have seen at Maison-Forte. He had
      accompanied Erebus at the time of the audacious journey of the three
      pirates in Provence. When they reached the port of Cette again, where they
      had left their chebec, they embarked and rejoined their galleys, which
      were anchored in the islands of Majorca, then open to all the pirates of
      the Mediterranean.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, Erebus, Pog, Trimalcyon, and Hadji&mdash;such was the name of the
      Bohemian&mdash;contrived their plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of the adventure in the gorges of Ollioules Hadji had described
      the old gentleman whom Erebus had just saved, and the young girl, to his
      hosts in Marseilles, who gave him the name of Raimond V. and his young
      daughter, for the Baron des Anbiez was well known in Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his sojourn at Majorca, Erebus, who in his leisure occupied himself
      in the art of painting, made as a souvenir the miniature of which we have
      spoken, and a skilful goldsmith enamelled the little dove on some objects
      intended for Reine. Finally, Erebus added a portrait of himself, which was
      placed in the medallion ornamenting the guzla of the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preparations completed, the Moor departed, taking with him, as a
      means of correspondence with the two pirates, two pigeons raised on board
      the chebec of Erebus, and habituated to seek and to recognise this vessel,
      which they regained with a jerk of the wing as soon as they perceived it,
      at a distance beyond the power of the eye of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of fifteen days, the two galleys and the chebec began to cruise
      and beat about in view of the coasts of Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, the month of December was Pog&rsquo;s gloomy month, the period
      in which his cruel instincts were exasperated to a ferocious monomania.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had dared present himself under an assumed name to the Marshal of
      Vitry, only to examine at leisure the state of the coast and the
      fortifications of Marseilles, as he had the audacious design of surprising
      and ravaging the city, and burning the port. He counted on his
      understanding with some Moors established in Marseilles, to make himself
      master of the boom of the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      However absurd or impossible it may appear, this attack, or rather this
      surprise, might have been successful. Pog did not despair of it If the
      arrangements that he had manipulated failed at his signal, he was sure at
      least of being able to lay waste a coast which was without defence, and
      the little city of La Ciotat, for reason of its proximity to Maison-Forte,
      must in this case share the fate of Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tumult of the battle, Reine des Anbiez could easily be carried off.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that the manoeuvres of the Bohemian succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long time hidden among the rocks which bordered upon Maison-Forte, he
      had several times seen Reine in the balcony of the window of her oratory,
      and had observed that this window often remained open. Thanks to his
      agility, the Bohemian had introduced himself there twice in the evening,&mdash;the
      first time with the crystal vase containing a Persian amaryllis, a bulbous
      plant which blooms in a few days; the second time with the miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain of having established these mysterious antecedents sufficiently
      well to excite the curiosity of Reine, and thus force her to think of
      Erebus, Hadji, thinking he could present himself at Maison-Forte without
      awakening suspicion, was returning to the house of Raimond V., and on the
      way met the recorder Isnard and his retinue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen days after his arrival at Maison-Forte, the chebec, at the setting
      of the sun, began to cruise at large. Hadji then sent one of the pigeons
      as the bearer of a letter, informing Erebus that he was loved, and Pog
      where he could attempt a landing, in case he should be compelled to
      renounce his intention of surprising Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman&rsquo;s eagle intercepted this correspondence by devouring the
      messenger. Unhappily, Hadji had another emissary. The next day, at sunset,
      the chebec appeared again, and a letter carried by the second pigeon
      announced to Erebus that he was loved, and to Pog that the most favourable
      moment for a descent upon La Ciotat was Christmas Day, a time when all the
      Provençals were occupied with their family feasts and merrymaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tempest began to blow the very evening of the day on which Erebus
      received this intelligence. He rejoined the two galleys which were
      cruising off the coast of Hyères; the weather becoming more and more
      violent, the three vessels put into Port Mage, on the island of Port-Cros.
      As we have said, they had been anchored there since the day before,
      impatiently waiting for the wind to change, as the celebration of
      Christmas would occur the day after the morrow. Before attempting anything
      at La Ciotat, Pog wished to assure himself that his enterprise on
      Marseilles was not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we are acquainted with the fatal ties which bound Erebus to Pog,
      we will follow the young adventurer on the galley of Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly ascended on board the <i>Sybarite</i> and entered the apartment
      where dinner was being served.

      CHAPTER XXVII. CONVERSATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      He wore the simple sailor costume which greatly enhanced his grace and
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes our bashful lover, our modest wooer,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon, seeing
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a reply, the young sailor, appreciative of this pleasantry, threw off
      his mantle, embroidered in jet-black silk, gave a kiss to Swan-skin,
      caressed Orangine&rsquo;s chin, and, taking up a silver goblet from the table,
      extended it to Trimalcyon as he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the health of Reine des Anbiez, the future favourite of my harem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog threw a piercing glance on Erebus, and said, in a measured, hollow
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These words come from his lips, his heart will give the lie to his
      language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Captain Pog; only land your demons on the beach of La
      Ciotat, and you will see if the brightness of the flames which will broil
      the French in their hole will prevent my following Hadji to the castle of
      that old Provençal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And once in that castle, what will you do, my boy?&rdquo; said Trimalcyon, with
      a mocking air. &ldquo;Will you ask if the beautiful girl has not a skein of silk
      to wind, or if she will permit you to hold her mirror while she combs her
      hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Full-Bottle, I will employ my time well. I will sing for her
      the song of the emir, a song worthy of Beni-Amer, which that fox, Hadji,
      made her listen to so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the old Provençal finds your voice disagreeable, he will give you
      a leather strap, as if you were a badly taught child, my boy,&rdquo; said
      Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will reply to the old gentleman by seizing his daughter in my arms, and
      singing to him those verses of Hadji:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;Till sixteen years old, the daughter belongs to her father.

     &ldquo;At sixteen years old, the daughter belongs to the lover.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the good man insists, you will give him, for your last word, your
      kangiar to end the conversation?&rdquo; &ldquo;That comes of course, Empty-Cup. Who
      carries off the daughter, kills the father,&rdquo; added Erebus, with an
      ironical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon wagged his head, and said to Pog, who seemed more and more
      absorbed in his gloomy thoughts: &ldquo;The young peacock is laughing at us, he
      is jesting, he will do some shepherd-swain nonsense with that girl.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has
      the French spy returned from the islands?&rdquo; asked Pog of Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Captain Pog,&rdquo; replied the young sailor; &ldquo;he departed with his
      stick and his wallet, disguised as a beggar. He will be here, without
      doubt, in an hour. I waited for him in vain. Seeing that he did not
      arrive, I came in my long-boat; the barge which landed him on the shore
      will bring him back here. But shall we attack La Ciotat or Marseilles,
      Captain Pog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marseilles, unless the report of the spy makes me change my opinion,&rdquo;
       said Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on our return, shall we not stop a moment at La Ciotat?&rdquo; asked
      Erebus. &ldquo;Hadji is expecting us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your beautiful maiden also, my boy. Ah! ah! you are more impatient to
      see her beautiful eyes than the gaping mouths of the cannon of the
      castle,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon, &ldquo;and you are right, I do not reproach you for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the cross of Malta, which I abhor!&rdquo; cried Erebus, with impatience, &ldquo;I
      would rather never see that lovely girl in the cabin of my chebec than not
      to sound my war-cry at the attack of Marseilles. Captain Pog knows that in
      all our combats with the French or with the galleys of religion, my arm,
      although young, has dealt some heavy blows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet! whether we attack Marseilles or not, you will be able to
      approach La Ciotat with your chebec and carry off your maiden. I will not
      allow you to lose this new chance of damning your soul, my dear child,&rdquo;
       said Pog, with a sinister laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul? You have always told me, Captain Pog, that I had no soul,&rdquo;
       replied the unhappy Erebus, with a bantering indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not see, my boy, that Captain Pog is jesting,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon,
      &ldquo;as far as the soul is concerned; but as for your beauty, by Sardanapalus!
      we will carry her off; the pains of Hadji and your mysterious gallantries
      shall not be lost, although, in my opinion, you were wrong to make
      yourself as romantic as an ancient Moor of Grenada, just to please this
      Omphale. A few more abductions, my dear child, and you will realise that
      it is far better to break a wild filly with violence than to tame her by
      dint of sweetness and petting. But your young palate requires milk and
      honey yet awhile. Later you will come to the spices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flatter me, Trimalcyon, by comparing me to a Moor of Grenada,&rdquo; said
      Erebus, with bitterness. &ldquo;They were noble and chivalrous, and not real
      robbers like us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Robbers? Do you hear him, Captain Pog? He is yet not
      more than half out of his shell, and he comes talking of robbers! And who
      in the devil told you we were robbers? That is the way they impose upon
      youth, the way they deceive it and corrupt it. Why, speak to him, I pray
      you, Captain Pog! Robbers! Give me something to drink, Swan-skin, to help
      me swallow that word! Zounds! Robbers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus seemed very little impressed by the grotesque anger of Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Pog raised his head slowly and said to the young man, with bitter
      irony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my dear child, you are right to blush for our profession.
      Upon my return to Tripoli, I will buy you a shop near the port,&mdash;it
      is the best mercantile quarter. There you can sell in peace and quietness
      white morocco-leather, Smyrna carpets and tapestry, Persian silks and
      ostrich feathers. That is an easy and honest calling, my dear child. You
      will be able to amass some money and afterward go to Malta, and establish
      yourself in the Jewish quarter. There you can lend your money at fifty per
      cent, to the chevaliers who are in debt. Thus you can avenge yourself on
      those who cut your father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s throats, by pocketing their
      money. It is more lucrative and less dangerous than taking your revenge in
      blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; cried Erebus, his cheeks flaming with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Pog is right,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon, &ldquo;the vampire that sucks the blood
      of his sleeping prey with impunity is better than the bold falcon that
      attacks him in the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trimalcyon, take care!&rdquo; cried the young man, in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who knows,&rdquo; continued Pog, &ldquo;if chance may not cause the chevalier who
      massacred your poor mother and noble father to fall under your usurious
      hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And see the avenging hand of Providence!&rdquo; cried Trimalcyon. &ldquo;The orphan
      becomes the creditor of the assassin! Blood and murder! Death and agony!
      This son, the avenger, at last gluts his rage by making the murderer of
      his family put on the yellow robe of insolvent debtors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this last sarcasm, the anger of Erebus exceeded all bounds, and he
      seized Trimalcyon by the throat and drew on him a knife that he had taken
      from the table. But for the iron grasp of Pog, which held the youth&rsquo;s hand
      like a vice, the fat pirate would have been dangerously wounded, if not
      killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Eblis and his black wings! Captain, take care! If you are provoked at
      the blow I was about to give that hog, then I will address myself to you!&rdquo;
       cried Erebus, trying to free himself from Pog&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swan-skin and Orangine escaped, shrieking with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what it is to spoil children,&rdquo; said Pog, with a disdainful smile, as
      he released the hand of Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to allow them to play with knives,&rdquo; replied Trimalcyon, picking up
      the knife that Erebus had let fall in the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look from Pog warned him that he must not push the young man too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to kill the one who has brought you up, dear child?&rdquo; said
      Pog, sarcastically. &ldquo;Come, you have your dagger in your belt, strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus looked at him with a surly air, and said, with an angry sneer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in the name of gratitude, then, that you ask me to spare your life?
      Then why have you preached to me the forgetfulness of benefits and the
      remembrance of injuries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his impudence, Trimalcyon looked at Pog in amazement, not
      knowing how his companion would reply to that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog gave Erebus a look of withering contempt, as he said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to test you, when I spoke of gratitude. Yes, the truly brave man
      forgets all benefits, and only remembers injuries. I offered you the most
      outrageous insult, I told you that you did not have the courage to avenge
      the death of your parents. You ought to have struck me at once,&mdash;but
      you are a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/278.jpg" alt="Pog, Calm and Unmoved, Opened his Breast "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Erebus quickly drew his dagger and raised it over the pirate before
      Trimalcyon could take a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, calm and unmoved, opened his breast without a sign of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice Erebus raised his arm, twice he let it fall again. He could not make
      up his mind to strike a defenceless man. He bowed his head with a
      sorrowful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog sat down again and said to Erebus, in a severe and imperious voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, do not quote maxims whose meaning perhaps you may comprehend, but
      which your weak heart will not let you put in practice. Listen to me, once
      for all. I received you without pity. I feel as much hatred and contempt
      for you as I do for all other men. I have trained you to pillage and
      murder, as I would have amused myself in training a young wolf for
      slaughter, that some day I might be able to hurl you against my enemies. I
      have killed all the chevaliers of Malta who have fallen into my hands,
      because I have a terrible vengeance to wreak on that order. I have taught
      you that your family was massacred by them, in the hope of exciting your
      rage, and turning it against those whom I execrate. You have already
      served my purpose; you have killed two caravanists with your own hand, in
      one combat. I know you had no pleasure in it, you thought you were
      avenging your father and mother. I deal with you as a man deals with his
      war-horse; as long as he serves him, he spurs him and urges him to the
      fray; when he becomes feeble, he sells him. Do not feel bound in any
      respect to me; kill me if you can. If you dare not strike before my face,
      act as a traitor,&mdash;you will succeed, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Erebus heard these frightful words, he seemed to be in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had never been deceived as to the tenderness of Pog, he believed
      that the man had at least an interest in him, the interest that a poor,
      abandoned child always inspires in one who has the care of him. The brutal
      confession of Pog left him no longer in doubt. These detestable maxims he
      had just uttered were too much in accord with the rest of his life to
      allow the young man to question their reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feelings of his own heart were inexplicable. He seemed to have fallen
      into some deep and bloody abyss. The thoughts which rushed upon him drove
      him to frenzy. His tender and generous instincts thrilled painfully, as if
      an iron hand had torn them from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first moment of dejection, the detestable influence of Pog
      regained the ascendency. Erebus wished to vie with this man in cynicism
      and barbarity. He lifted up his pale face, and said, as a sarcastic smile
      played upon his lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have enlightened me, Captain Pog; until now, the hatred of the
      soldiers of Christ had never entered into my heart; until now, I only
      wished their death because they had killed my father and mother; if I
      showed them no mercy, I fought them, sword to sword, galley to galley. But
      now, captain, armed or disarmed, young or old, fairly or basely, I will
      kill as many as I can kill,&mdash;do you know why, captain? Say, do you
      know why, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is out of his head!&rdquo; whispered Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he says what he feels,&rdquo; replied Pog. &ldquo;Ah, well, then, my child, tell
      me why?&rdquo; added he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because in making me an orphan, they put me in your power, and you have
      made me what I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was in the expression of the features of Erebus something which
      revealed a hatred so implacable, that Trimalcyon whispered to Pog:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is blood in his look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus, although exasperated beyond measure by the contemptuous hatred of
      Pog, did not dare avenge himself, because he was dominated by an
      involuntary sentiment of gratitude toward the man who had reared him, and
      with an air of desperation he went out of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to kill himself!&rdquo; cried Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some moments after, while the two companions sat in gloomy silence, they
      heard the sound of oars striking the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going back to his chebec,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, Pog went out of the chamber and walked to the prow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late. The wind had grown somewhat calm; the galley-slaves were
      sleeping on their benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was heard but the regular step of the spahis who walked their
      rounds on the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, leaning over the guards, looked at the sea in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon, in spite of his depravity, had been moved by this scene. Never
      had the cruel monomania of Pog shown itself in such a horrible light. He
      felt a certain embarrassment in engaging in conversation with his silent
      friend. At last, approaching him with several &ldquo;Hem&mdash;Hems,&rdquo; and
      numerous hesitations, he said: &ldquo;The weather is very fine this evening,
      Captain Pog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your remark is full of sense, Trimalcyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the point now, and shame to the devil! I do not know what to say
      to you, Pog, but you are a terrible man; you will make that poor starling
      insane. How in the devil can you find pleasure in tormenting the young
      fellow so? Some fine day he will leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were not a man incapable of understanding me, Trimalcyon, I would
      tell you that what I feel for this unfortunate youth is strange,&rdquo; said
      Pog. &ldquo;Yes, it is strange,&rdquo; continued he, talking to himself. &ldquo;Sometimes I
      feel furious anger rising in me against Erebus, a resentment as implacable
      as if he were my most deadly enemy. Again I have the indifference of a
      piece of ice. Other times I feel for him a compassion, I would say
      affection if that sentiment could enter my soul. Then, the sound of his
      voice&mdash;yes, especially the sound of his voice&mdash;and his look
      awaken in me memories of a time which is no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered these last words, Pog spoke indistinctly. Trimalcyon was
      touched by the accent of his usually morose companion. The voice of Pog,
      ordinarily hard and sarcastic, softened almost to a lamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon, amazed, approached Pog to speak to him; he recoiled in fright
      as he saw him suddenly raise his two fists toward Heaven in a threatening
      manner, and heard him utter such a painful, despairing cry that there
      seemed nothing human in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Pog, what is the matter with you? What is the matter with you?&rdquo;
       cried Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with me!&rdquo; cried Pog, in a delirium, &ldquo;what is the
      matter with me! Then you do not know that this man who stands here before
      you, who roars with pain, who pushes cruelty to madness, who dreams only
      of blood and massacre; that this man was once blessed with all, because he
      was good, kind, and generous. You do not know, oh, you do not know the
      evil that must have been done to this man to excite in him the rage which
      now possesses him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon was more and more amazed at this language, which contrasted so
      singularly with the habitual character of Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to enlighten himself by carefully examining the countenance of
      his old comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long silence he heard the dry, strident laugh of the pirate ring
      through the galley. &ldquo;Eh, eh! comrade,&rdquo; said Pog, in the tone of irony
      natural to him, &ldquo;it is quite right to say that at night mad dogs bark at
      the moon! Have you understood one word of all the nonsense I have just
      uttered to you? I would have been a good actor, on my faith I would; do
      you not think so, comrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not understood much, to tell the truth, Captain Pog, except that
      you have not been always what you are now. We are alike in that. I was a
      servant in a college before being a pirate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog, without making a reply, made a gesture of his hand commanding
      silence. Then, listening with attention on the side next to the sea, he
      said: &ldquo;It seems to me I hear a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; said Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the watchmen on the rambade uttered three distinct cries, the first
      separated from the two last by quite a long interval; the last two,
      however, were close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patron of the boat replied to this cry in the opposite manner; that is
      to say, he uttered at first two short, quick cries, followed by a
      prolonged cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are persons from the chebec, and the spy, no doubt,&rdquo; said
      Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the long-boat was already at the first seat of the rowers. The spy
      climbed to the deck of the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news from Hyères?&rdquo; said Pog to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad for Marseilles, captain; the galleys of the Marquis de Brézé, coming
      from Naples, anchored there yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; asked Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two bargemasters. I entered a hostelry to beg an alms, and these
      bargemasters were talking about it. Some mule-drivers, coming from the
      west, heard the same thing at St. Tropez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what rumour on the coast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are alarmed at La Ciotat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog waved his hand, and the spy retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, Captain Pog?&rdquo; cried Trimalcyon. &ldquo;There are only blows
      to be gained at Marseilles; the squadron of the Marquis de Brézé protects
      the port. To attack an enemy unseasonably is to do him good instead of
      harm; we can do nothing at Marseilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Captain Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then La Ciotat invites us; the swine, those citizens, are alarmed, it is
      true, but, Sardanapalus! what does that matter? The little birds tremble
      when they see the hawk ready to pounce upon them; but do their terrors
      make his claws any the less sharp, or his beak less cutting? What do you
      say to it, Captain Pog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To La Ciotat, to-morrow at sunset, if the wind ceases. We will surprise
      these people in the midst of a feast; we will change their cries of joy
      into cries of death!&rdquo; said Pog, in a hollow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sardanapalus! these citizens, they say, have hens on golden eggs hidden
      in their houses. They say that the convent of the Minimes brothers is
      filled with costly wines, without counting the money of the farm-rent that
      the farmers bring to these rich do-nothings at Christmas. We will find
      their cash-box well furnished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To La Ciotat,&rdquo; said Pog; &ldquo;The wind may change in our favour. I am going
      to return on board the <i>Red Galleon</i>; at the first signal, follow my
      manoeuvre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, Captain Pog,&rdquo; replied Trimalcyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the pirates, ambushed in that solitary bay, are preparing to
      surprise and attack the inhabitants of La Ciotat, we will return to Cape
      l&rsquo;Aigle, where we left the watchman occupied in drawing up the defence of
      the coast.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. HADJI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Christmas had at last arrived.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Although the fear of the Barbary pirates had kept the city and the coast
      in alarm for several days, the people began to feel safe from attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The north wind had lasted so long and had blown with such violence that
      they did not suppose the pirate vessels dared put to sea in such weather,
      and it seemed still less probable that they would anchor in a harbour on
      their seashore, which was exactly what Pog and Trimalcyon had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The security felt by the inhabitants was fatal to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty hours at least were required for the galley of the commander to sail
      from Cape Corsica to La Ciotat. The tempest had ceased only the evening
      before, and Pierre des Anbiez had been compelled to wait until Christmas
      morning to put to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, the galleys of the pirates were able to reach La Ciotat
      in three hours; the island of Port-Cros, where they had taken refuge, was
      only about six leagues distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as we have said, fear was no longer felt along the coast; besides,
      they reckoned upon the well-known vigilance of the watchman, Master
      Peyrou.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would give the alarm in case of danger; two signals, corresponding with
      the sentry-box on Cape l&rsquo;Aigle, had been established, one at a point
      opposite the bay, the other on the terrace of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the slightest alarm all the men of La Ciotat, capable of bearing arms,
      were to assemble in the town hall, there to take orders from the consul,
      and hasten to the point which might be attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chain had been extended across the entrance of the port, and several
      large fishing-boats, armed with swivel-guns, were anchored a short
      distance from this chain. Finally, two coxswains of a long-boat, occupied
      a whole morning in exploring the environage, had upon their return
      increased the general feeling of security by announcing that not a sail
      was to be seen for a distance of three or four leagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about two hours after midday. A sharp wind from the east had taken
      the place of the north wind of the preceding days. The sky was clear, the
      sun bright for a winter day, and the sea beautiful, although there was a
      gentle swell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child carrying a basket on his head began to climb, singing all the
      while, the steep rocks which led to the house of the watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, hearing the moaning of a dog, the child stopped, looked around
      him with curiosity, saw nothing, and went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry was repeated, and this time it seemed nearer and more pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. had been hunting all day on that side, and thinking that one of
      the baron&rsquo;s dogs had fallen into some quagmire, the child set his basket
      down on the ground, climbed up a large piece of a huge rock which
      projected some distance over the road, and listened with attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cries of the dog grew fainter, yet sounded more plaintive than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child hesitated no longer. As much to do something which would please
      his master as to merit a small recompense, he began diligently to search
      for the poor animal, and soon disappeared among the tall rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog seemed sometimes nearer, and sometimes more distant; at last the
      cries suddenly ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child had left the path. While he was listening, calling, crying, and
      whistling, Hadji, the Bohemian, appeared behind a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to his skill as a juggler, he had imitated the cries of the dog, so
      as to distract the child from his duty and take him away from his basket.
      For three days he had been wandering in the midst of this solitude. Not
      daring to appear again at Maison-Forte, he was expecting every day the
      arrival of the pirates, who had been instructed by his second message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that every morning provisions were carried to Peyrou, Hadji, who
      had been watching some hours for the purveyor, employed, as we have said,
      this stratagem to make him abandon his basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian opened the bottle-case carefully provided by the majordomo
      Laramée, took out a large bottle covered with straw, and poured in it a
      small quantity of a white powder,&mdash;a powerful soporific, whose
      effects had already been felt by the worthy Luquin Trinquetaille.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian had lived for two days on the small amount of food he had
      carried away from Maison-Forte; but, fearing to excite suspicion, he had
      the courage not to touch the appetising viands intended for the watchman.
      He restored the bottle to its place and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child, after having searched for the stray dog in vain, returned, took
      up his basket, and finally arrived at the summit of the promontory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Peyrou passed for such a formidable, mysterious being, that his
      young purveyor did not dare say a word about the cries of the dog; he
      deposited the basket on the edge of the last stone of the steps, and
      saying, in a trembling voice, &ldquo;The good God keep you, Master Peyrou,&rdquo;
       descended as fast as his legs could carry him, holding his cap in both
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman smiled at the child&rsquo;s fear, rose from his seat, went for the
      basket, and set it down near him. The provisions inside smacked of the
      Christmas festivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was a very fine roast turkey, a necessary dish at the solemn
      feast of Christmas; then a cold fish pie, some honey cakes and oil, and a
      basket of grapes and dried fruit done up in the style of a Christmas
      present; finally, two loaves of white bread with a golden brown crust, and
      a large bottle, containing at least two pints of the finest Burgundy wine
      from the cellar of Raimond V., completed his repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good watchman, lonely philosopher as he was, did not appear insensible
      to these good things. He entered his house, took his little table, set it
      before his door, and there placed his preparations for his Christmas
      feast. Yet he was saddened by melancholy thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the unusual clouds of smoke rising above the town of La Ciotat, it
      could be seen that the inhabitants, rich or poor, were making joyous
      preparations to unite family and friends at their tables. The watchman
      sighed as he thought of the exile which he had imposed upon himself.
      Already old, without relatives and family ties, he was liable to die on
      this rock, in the midst of this imposing solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cause brought sadness to the heart of Peyrou. He had vainly hoped
      to signal the arrival of the commander&rsquo;s galley. He knew with what joy
      Raimond V. would have embraced his two brothers, especially at this
      season, and he also knew that the gloomy sadness of Pierre des Anbiez
      found some relief, some consolation in the midst of sweet family happiness
      and festivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact, there was still another reason, not less important, which
      made the watchman desire most earnestly the return of the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been for more than twenty years the guardian of a terrible secret,
      and of the papers which were connected with it. His retired life and his
      fidelity, which had endured every test, were sufficient warrants for the
      security of this secret. But the watchman desired to ask the commander to
      deliver him from this grave responsibility, and to entrust it henceforth
      to Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Peyrou realised that he might at any time die a violent death;
      his scene with the Bohemian proved to what dangers he was exposed in this
      remote and isolated spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these reasons made him look anxiously for the coming of the black
      galley, and for the last time, before sitting down to the table, he
      examined the horizon attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was just beginning to set, and although the watchman descried
      nothing in the distance, he did not lose all hope of seeing the galley
      before nightfall, and to be able to signal the galley more readily, he
      resolved to dine outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of a good dinner drove some of the wrinkles from his brow. He
      began by holding the flagon of Burgundy wine to his lips. After having
      swallowed several draughts, he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand,
      as he quoted the Provençal proverb, &ldquo;<i>A Tousan tou vin es san</i>,&mdash;On
      All Saints&rsquo; Day all wine is good for the health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raimond V. has not forgotten how to judge,&rdquo; added he, smiling. Then he
      carved the turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, for an old man, old wine. I feel my heart already rejoice,
      and my hopes of seeing the commander&rsquo;s galley are a good deal brighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Peyrou heard a rustling in the air; one of the branches of
      the old pine cracked, and Brilliant alighted with a heavy wing on the
      stone roof of the sentry-box; then from the roof she descended to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! Brilliant,&rdquo; said the watchman, &ldquo;you come to get your part of the
      Christmas present, do you? Take this!&rdquo; and he handed her a piece of the
      turkey, which the eagle refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! cruel wretch, you would not disdain that morsel if it was bloody. Do
      you want some of this pie? No? Ah! you will not find every day such a
      treat as the pigeon of that accursed Bohemian. Never shall I forget the
      service you rendered me, my courageous bird, although your taste for blood
      went for much in your fine action. But, no matter, Brilliant, no matter;
      it smells of ingratitude to be looking for the motive of a deed by which
      we have profited. I ought to have thought of you and given you a fine
      quarter of mutton for your Christmas feast. But to-morrow I will not
      forget For you, as for a great many men, the treat makes the festivity,
      and it is not the holy day or saint they glorify.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Peyrou finished his dinner, sometimes chatting with Brilliant, and
      sometimes embracing the baron&rsquo;s bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was slowly descending upon the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman, wrapping himself in his cloak, lit his pipe, and sat down to
      contemplate the approach of the beautiful winter night, in a sort of
      meditative beatitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the night was falling, he again examined the horizon with his
      telescope, and discovered nothing. Turning his head mechanically on the
      side of Maison-Forte, with the thought that all hope of seeing the
      commander arrive was not yet lost, he saw, to his great astonishment, a
      company of soldiers, commanded by two men on horseback, rapidly marching
      up the beach toward the house of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized his telescope, and, in spite of the gathering darkness,
      recognised the recorder Isnard, mounted on his white mule. The recorder
      was accompanied by a cavalier, whose hausse-col, or metal collar, jacket
      of buff-skin, and white scarf marked him as a captain of infantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; cried the watchman, recalling with alarm the
      animosity of Master Isnard. &ldquo;Are they going to arrest the Baron des Anbiez
      by virtue of an order from the Marshal of Vitry? Ah! I have too much
      reason to fear it, and what I fear more is the resistance of the baron. My
      God! how is all this going to end? What a sad Christmas if things are as I
      fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Greatly disturbed, the watchman stood with his eyes fixed on the shore,
      although night was now too far advanced to permit him to distinguish any
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the moon rose bright and clear, flooding the rocks, the bay, the
      shore, and the castle of Maison-Forte with her brilliant light.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the distance the city, immersed in fog, showed many a luminous point
      through the cloudy, vapourous mass, and its sharp-pointed roofs and
      belfries cut a black silhouette on the pale azure of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea, perfectly calm, was like a peaceful lake, and its soft murmurs
      were scarcely audible. The waves seemed to sleep. A line of darker blue
      marked the curve of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman looked anxiously at the windows of Maison-Forte, which were
      all brilliantly illuminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, his eyelids grew heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attributing the sensation of heaviness in his head to the wine, which he
      had partaken of in moderation, he began to walk about briskly, but,
      notwithstanding his persistent efforts, he felt a sort of lassitude
      stealing through all his limbs. His sight began to grow dim; he was
      obliged to return and sit down on his bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes he struggled with all his might against this numbness
      which was gradually taking possession of all his faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, although his reason commenced to share this state of general
      stupor, he had the presence of mind to go in his cabin and plunge his head
      in a basin of ice-cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      This immersion seemed for some moments to restore to him the use of his
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable creature I am! What have I done!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I have made myself
      drunk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a few more steps, but was obliged to sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soporific, thwarted in its effect for a moment, redoubled its power
      over him. Leaning back against the wall of his cabin, he retained
      perception enough to be the witness of a spectacle which overwhelmed him
      with rage and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two galleys and a chebec appeared at the eastern point of the bay,&mdash;a
      point which he alone was able to discover from the height of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle.
      These vessels were slowly doubling the promontory with the utmost
      precaution. With one last effort he straightened himself up to his full
      height, and cried, in a feeble voice, &ldquo;Pirates!&rdquo; He stumbled as he tried
      to walk to the pile where were collected all sorts of combustible material
      ready to be kindled at a moment&rsquo;s notice. The moment he reached it he
      fell, deprived of consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, who had been watching his every movement, then appeared just
      where the foot-path entered the esplanade, and advanced with the greatest
      circumspection. Hiding himself behind the cabin, he listened, and heard
      only the laboured breathing of the watchman. Certain of the effect of his
      soporific, he approached Peyrou, stooped down, and touched his hands and
      his forehead and found that they were cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dose is strong,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps too strong. So much the worse, I
      did not wish to kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then advancing to the edge of the precipice, he saw distinctly the three
      pirate vessels in the distance. Moving slowly and cautiously, for fear of
      being discovered, they made use of oars to reach the entrance of the port,
      where the Bohemian was to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practised eye of Hadji recognised in front of the two galleys certain
      luminous points or flames, which were nothing else than torches designed
      to burn the city and the fishing-boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Eblis! they are going to smoke these citizens like foxes in their
      burrows. It is time, perhaps, for this old man to go to sleep for ever;
      but we must visit his cabin. I will have time to descend. I will be on the
      beach soon enough to seize a boat and join Captain Pog, who expects me
      before he begins the attack. Let us enter; they say the old man hides a
      treasure here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadji took a brand from the fireplace and lit a lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first object which met his eye was a trunk or box of sculptured ebony
      placed near the watchman&rsquo;s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a costly piece of furniture for such a recluse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not finding a key, he took a hatchet, broke open the lock, and opened the
      two leaves of the door; the shelves were empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not natural to lock up nothing with so much precaution; time
      presses, but this key will open everything.&rdquo; He took up the hatchet again,
      and in a moment the ebony case was in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      A double bottom fell apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian uttered a cry of joy as he perceived the little embossed
      silver casket of which we have spoken, and on which was marked a Maltese
      cross. This casket, which was quite heavy, was fastened no doubt by a
      secret spring, as neither key nor lock could be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my fine part of the booty, now let us run to help Captain Pog in
      taking his. Ah, ah!&rdquo; added he, with a diabolical laugh, as he beheld the
      bay and the city wrapped in profound stillness, &ldquo;soon Eblis will shake his
      wings of fire over that scene. The sky will be in flames, and the waters
      will run with blood!&rdquo; Then, as a last precaution, he emptied a tunnel of
      water on the signal pile, and descended in hot haste to join the pirate
      vessels.

      CHAPTER XXIX. CHRISTMAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      While so many misfortunes were threatening the city, the inhabitants were
      quietly keeping Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the uneasiness the opinion of the watchman had given,
      notwithstanding the alarm caused by terror of the pirates, in every house,
      poor or rich, preparations were being made for the patriarchal feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have spoken of the magnificent cradle which had long been in course of
      preparation through the untiring industry of Dame Dulceline.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at last finished and placed in the hall of the dais, or hall of
      honour in Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight had just sounded. The woman in charge was impatiently awaiting
      the return of Raimond V., his daughter, Honorât de Berrol, and other
      relations and guests whom the baron had invited to the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the family and guests had gone to La Ciotat, to be present at the
      midnight mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbé Mascarolus had said mass in the chapel of the castle for those who
      had remained at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will conduct the reader to the hall of the dais, which occupied
      two-thirds of the long gallery which communicated with the two wings of
      the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was never opened except on solemn occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A splendid red damask silk covered its walls. To supply the place of
      flowers, quite rare in that season, masses of green branches, cut from
      trees and arranged in boxes, hid almost entirely the ten large arched
      windows of this immense hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one end of the hall rose a granite chimneypiece, ten feet high and
      heavily sculptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the season was cold, no fire burned in this vast
      fireplace, but an immense pile, composed of branches of vine, beech,
      olive, and fir-apples, only waited the formality of custom to throw waves
      of light and heat into the grand and stately apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two pine-trees with long green branches ornamented with ribbons, oranges,
      and bunches of grapes, were set up in boxes on each side of the chimney,
      and formed above the mantelpiece a veritable thicket of verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six copper chandeliers with lighted yellow wax candles only partially
      dissipated the darkness of the immense room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other end, opposite the chimney, rose the dais, resembling somewhat
      the canopy of a bed, with curtains, hangings, and cushions of red damask,
      as were, too, the mantle and gloves, a part of the equipment of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red draperies covered, with their long folds, five wooden steps, which
      were hidden under a rich Turkey carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily the armorial chair of Raimond V. was placed on this elevation,
      and here enthroned, the old gentleman, as lord of the manor, administered
      on rare occasions justice to high and low. On Christmas Day, however, the
      cradle of the infant Jesus occupied this place of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A table of massive oak, covered over with a rich oriental drapery,
      furnished the middle of the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this table could be seen an ebony box handsomely carved, with a coat of
      arms on its lid. This box contained the book of accounts, a sort of record
      in which were written the births and all other important family events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armchairs and benches of carved oak, with twisted feet, completed the
      furniture of this hall, to which its size and severe bareness gave an
      imposing character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dame Dulceline and Abbé Mascarolus had just finished placing the cradle
      under the dais. This marvel was a picture in relief about three feet
      square at the base and three feet high. The faithful representation of the
      stable where the Saviour was born would have been too severe a limitation
      to the poetical conceptions of the good abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, instead of a stable, the holy scene was pictured under a sort of
      arcade sustained by two half ruined supports. In the spaces between the
      stones, real little stones artistically cut, were hung long garlands of
      natural vines and leaves, most beautifully intertwined.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cloud of white wax seemed to envelope the upper part of the arcade. Five
      or six cherubs about a thumb high, modelled in wax painted a natural
      colour, and wearing azure wings made of the feathers of humming-birds,
      were here and there set in the cloud, and held a streamer of white silk,
      in the middle of which glittered the words, embroidered in letters of
      gold: Gloria in Jezcelriir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supports of the arcade rested on a sort of carpet of fine moss, packed
      so closely as to resemble green velvet, and in front of this erection was
      placed the cradle of the Saviour of the world; a real, miniature cradle,
      covered over with the richest laces. In it reposed the infant Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling by the cradle, the Virgin Mary bent over the Babe her maternal
      brow, the white veil of the Queen of Angels falling over her feet and
      hiding half of her azure coloured silk robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paschal lamb, his four feet bound with a rose coloured ribbon, was
      laid at the foot of the cradle; behind it the kneeling ox thrust his large
      head, and his eyes of enamel seemed to contemplate the divine Infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ass, on a more distant plane, and half hidden by the posts of the
      arcade, behind which it stood, also showed his meek and gentle head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog seemed to cringe near the cradle, while the shepherds, clothed in
      coarse cassocks, and the magi kings, dressed in rich robes of brocatelle,
      were offering their adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fourth row of little candles, made of rose-scented wax, burned around
      the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense amount of work, and really great resources of imagination, had
      been necessary to perfect such an exquisite picture. For instance, the
      ass, which was about six thumbs in height, was covered in mouse-skin which
      imitated his own to perfection. The black and white ox owed his hair to an
      India pig of the same colour, and his short and polished black horns to
      the rounded nippers of an enormous beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The robes of the magi kings revealed a fairy-like skill and patience, and
      their long white hair was really veritable hair, which Dame Dulceline had
      cut from her own venerable head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the figures of the cherubs, the infant Jesus, and other actors in
      this holy scene, they had been purchased in Marseilles from one of those
      master wax-chandlers, who always kept assorted materials necessary in the
      construction of these cradles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless it was not high art, but there was, in this little monument of a
      laborious and innocent piety, something as simple and as pathetic as the
      divine scene which they tried to reproduce with such religious
      conscientiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good old priest and Dame Dulceline, after having lit the last candles
      which surrounded the cradle, stood a moment, lost in admiration of their
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, M. Abbé,&rdquo; said Dame Dulceline, &ldquo;have we had such a beautiful
      cradle at Maison-Forte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Dame Dulceline; the representation of the animals
      approaches nature as closely as is permitted man to approach the marvels
      of creation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, M. Abbé, why did it have to be that the accursed Bohemian, who they
      say is an emissary of the pirates, should give us the secret of making
      glass eyes for these animals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter, Dame Dulceline? Perhaps some day the miscreant will
      learn the eternal truth. The Lord employs every arm to build his temple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray tell me, M. Abbé, why we must put the cradle under the dais in the
      hall of honour. Soon it will be forty years since I began making cradles
      for Maison-Forte des Anbiez. My mother made them for Raimond IV., father
      of Raimond V., for as many years. Ah, well! I have never asked before, nor
      have I even asked myself why this hall was always selected for the blessed
      exposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you see, Dame Dulceline, there is always, at the base of our ancient
      religious customs, something consoling for the humble, the weak, and the
      suffering, and also something imposing as a lesson for the happy and the
      rich and the powerful of this world. This cradle, for instance, is the
      symbol of the birth of the divine Saviour. He was the poor child of a poor
      artisan, and yet some day he was to be as far above the most powerful of
      men as the heavens are above the earth. So you see, Dame Dulceline, upon
      the anniversary day of the redemption, the poor and rustic cradle of the
      infant Saviour takes the place of honour in the ceremonial hall of the
      noble baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand, M. Abbé, they put the infant Jesus in the place of the
      noble baron, to show that the lords of this world should be first to bow
      before the Saviour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, Dame Dulceline, in thus doing homage to the Lord through
      the symbol of his power, the baron preaches by example the communion and
      equality of men before God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dame Dulceline remained silent a moment, thinking of the abbé&rsquo;s words,
      then, satisfied with his explanation, she proposed another question to
      him, which in her mind was more difficult of solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Abbé,&rdquo; asked she, with an embarrassed air, &ldquo;you say that at the base
      of all ancient customs there is always a lesson; can there be one, then,
      in the custom of Palm Sunday, when foundling children run about the
      streets of Marseilles with branches of laurel adorned with fruit? For
      instance, last year, on Palm Sunday,&mdash;I blush to think of it even
      now, M. Abbé,&mdash;I was walking on the fashionable promenade of
      Marseilles with Master Tale-bard-Talebardon, who was not then the declared
      enemy of monseigneur, and, lo! one of the unfortunate little foundlings
      stopped right before me and the consul, and said, with a sweet voice, as
      he kissed our hands, &lsquo;Good morning, mother! good morning, father!&rsquo; By St
      Dulceline, my patron saint, M. Abbé, I turned purple with shame, and
      Master Talebard-Talebardon did, too. I beg your pardon, respectfully, for
      alluding to the coarse jokes of Master Laramée, who accompanied us, on the
      subject of this poor foundling&rsquo;s insult! But this Master Laramée has
      neither modesty nor shame. I could not help repulsing with horror this
      nursling of public charity, and I pinched his arm sharply, and said to
      him: &lsquo;Will you be silent, you ugly little bastard?&rsquo; He felt his fault, for
      he began to weep, and when I complained of his indecent impudence to a
      grave citizen, he replied to me: &lsquo;My good lady, such is the custom here;
      on Palm Sunday foundlings have the privilege of running through the
      streets, and saying, &lsquo;father and mother,&rsquo; to all whom they may meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is really the custom, Dame Dulceline,&rdquo; said the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it may be the custom, M. Abbé, but is that not a very impertinent
      and improper custom, to permit unfortunate little children without father
      or mother to walk up and say &lsquo;mother&rsquo; to honest, discreet persons like
      myself, for example, who prefer the peace of celibacy to the disquietudes
      of family? As to the morality of this custom, I pray you explain it, M.
      Abbé. I look for it in vain with all my eyes. I can see nothing in it but
      what is outrageously indecent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are mistaken, Dame Dulceline,&rdquo; said Abbé Mascarolus; &ldquo;this custom
      is worthy of respect, and you were wrong to treat that poor child so
      cruelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wrong? That little rascal comes and calls me mother, and I permit
      it? Why, then, thanks to this custom, there would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to this custom,&rdquo; interrupted the abbé, &ldquo;thanks to the privilege
      that these little unfortunates have, of being able to say, one day in the
      year, &lsquo;father and mother&rsquo; to those they meet,&mdash;those dear names that
      they never pronounce, which, perhaps, may have never passed their lips&mdash;alas!
      how many there are, and I have seen them, who say these words with tears
      in their eyes, as they remember that, when that day is past, they cannot
      repeat the blessed words! And sometimes it happens, Dame Dulceline, that
      strangers, moved to pity by such innocence and sorrow, or being touched by
      the caressing words, have adopted some of these unfortunates; others have
      given abundant alms, because this innocent appeal for charity is almost
      always heard. You see, Dame Dulceline, that this custom, too, has a useful
      end,&mdash;a pious signification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman bowed her head in silence, and finally replied to the good
      chaplain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a clever man, M. Abbé; you are right. See what it is to have
      knowledge! Now I repent of having repulsed the child so cruelly. Next Palm
      Sunday I will not fail to carry several yards of good, warm cloth, and
      nice linen, and this time, I promise you, I will not act the cruel
      stepmother with the poor children who call me mother! But if that old sot,
      Laramée, makes any indecent joke about me, as sure as he has eyes I will
      prove to him that I have claws!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would prove too much, Dame Dulceline. But, since monseigneur does
      not yet return, and since we are discussing the customs of our good old
      Provence, and their usefulness to poor people, come, now, what have you
      observed on the day of St Lazarus, concerning the dance of St Elmo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to tell you, M. Abbé? Now I distrust myself; before
      your explanation I railed against the custom of foundlings on Palm Sunday,
      now I respect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say always, Dame Dulceline, that the sin of ignorance is excusable. But
      what is your opinion concerning the dance of St Elmo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, M. Abbé, I understand nothing about it! I sometimes ask myself
      what is the good, the day of the feast of St. Elmo, of dressing up, at the
      expense of the city or community, all the poor young boys and girls as
      handsomely as possible. That is not all. Not content with that, these
      young people go from house to house, among the rich citizens and the
      lords, asking to borrow something. This one wants a gold necklace, that
      one a pair of diamond earrings, another a silver belt, another a hatband
      set with precious stones, or a sword-belt braided in gold. Ah, well! in my
      opinion,&mdash;but I may change it in an hour,&mdash;M. Abbé, it is wrong
      to lend all these costly articles to poor people and artisans who have not
      a cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? Since the feast of St. Lazarus has been celebrated here, have you
      ever heard, Dame Dulceline, that any of those precious jewels have been
      lost or stolen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God in Heaven! Never, M. Abbé, neither here, nor in Marseilles, nor
      in all Provence, I believe. Thank God, our youth is honest, after all! For
      instance, last year Mlle. Reine loaned her Venetian girdle, which
      Stephanette says cost more than two thousand crowns. Ah, well! Thereson,
      the daughter of the miller at Pointe-aux-Cailles, who wore this costly
      ornament during all the feast, came and brought it back before sunset,
      although she had permission to keep it till night. And for this same feast
      of St. Lazarus, monseigneur loaned to Pierron, the fisherman of
      Maison-Forte, his beautiful gold chain, and his medallion set with rubies,
      that Master Laramée cleans, as you told him to do, with teardrops of the
      vine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true; and if one can mix with these teardrops of the vine a tear
      of a stag killed in venison season, Dame Dulceline, the rubies will shine
      like sparks of fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, M. Abbé, Pierron, the fisherman, brought back faithfully that
      precious chain even before the appointed hour. I repeat, M. Abbé, our
      youth is an honest youth, but I do not see the use of risking the loss,
      not by theft, but by accident, of beautiful jewels, for the pleasure of
      seeing these young people dance the old Provençal dances in the streets
      and roads, to the sound of tambourines and cymbalettes and flutes, that
      play the national airs, ooubados and bedocheos, until you are deaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, Dame Dulceline,&rdquo; said Mascarolus, smiling sweetly, &ldquo;you are
      going to learn that you were wrong not to see in this custom, too, a
      lesson and a use. When mademoiselle loaned to Thereson, the poor daughter
      of a miller, a costly ornament, she showed a blind confidence in the girl;
      now, Dame Dulceline, confidence begets honesty and prevents dishonesty.
      That is not all; in giving Thereson the pleasure of wearing this ornament
      for one day, our young mistress showed her at the same time the charm and
      the nothingness of it, and then, as this pleasure is not forbidden to the
      poor people, they do not look on it with jealousy. This custom, in fact,
      establishes delightful relations between rich and poor, which are based on
      probity, confidence, and community of interest What do you think now of
      the dance of St. Elmo, Dame Dulceline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, M. Chaplain, that, although I have no jewels but a cross and a
      gold chain, I will lend them with a good heart to young Madelon, the best
      worker in my laundry, on the next feast of St. Lazarus, because every time
      I take this gold cross out of its box the poor girl devours it with her
      eyes, and I am sure that she will be wild with joy. But I am getting
      bewildered, M. Abbé; I brought some pure oil to fill the two Christmas
      lamps, which mademoiselle is to light, and I was about to forget them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of oil, Dame Dulceline, do not forget to fill well with oil that
      jug in which I have steeped those two beautiful bunches of grapes. I wish
      to attempt the experiment cited by M. de Maucaunys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What experiment, M. Abbé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This erudite and veracious traveller pretends that by leaving bunches of
      grapes, gathered on the day which marks the middle of September, in a jug
      of pure oil for seven months, the oil will acquire such a peculiar
      property that whenever it burns in a lamp whose light is thrown on the
      wall or the floor, thousands of bunches of grapes will appear on this wall
      or floor, perfect in colour, but as deceptive as objects painted on
      glass.&rdquo; Dame Dulceline was just about to testify her admiration for the
      good and credulous chaplain, when she heard in the court the sound of
      carriage and horses, which announced the return of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared precipitately. The door opened, and Raimond V. entered the
      gallery with several ladies and gentlemen, friends and their wives, who
      had also been present at the midnight mass in the parochial church of La
      Ciotat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron and the other men were in holiday attire, and the women in that
      dress which going and coming on horseback rendered necessary, inasmuch as
      carriages were very rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the countenance of Raimond V. was always joyous and cordial when
      he welcomed his guests at Maison-Forte, an expression of sadness from time
      to time now came over his features, for he had relinquished all hope of
      seeing his brothers at this family festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests of the baron all admired the cradle Dame Dulceline had prepared
      with so much skill, and the chaplain received the praises of the company
      with as much modesty as gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât de Berrol appeared more melancholy than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine, on the contrary, realising the necessity for making him forget the
      refusal of her hand, which she had at last decided upon, by means of
      various evidences of kindness and friendship, treated the young man with
      cousinly esteem and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, she was conscious of a painful embarrassment; she had not
      yet informed the baron of her determination not to marry Honorât de
      Berrol. She had only obtained her father&rsquo;s consent to have the nuptials
      delayed until the return of the commander and Father Elzear, who, from
      what was implied in their last letters, might arrive at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eulogies on the cradle seemed inexhaustible, when the baron, approaching
      the company of admiring guests, said: &ldquo;My opinion is, ladies, that we had
      better begin the <i>cachofué</i>, for this hall is very damp and cold, and
      the fire is only waiting to blaze!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>cachofué</i>, or <i>feu caché</i>, was an old Provençal ceremony,
      which consisted of bringing in a Christmas log and lighting it every
      evening until the New Year. This log was lighted and extinguished, so that
      it would last the given time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, the <i>cachofué</i>, baron!&rdquo; exclaimed the ladies, gaily. &ldquo;You
      are to be the actor in the ceremony, so the time to begin depends on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my friends, I hoped indeed that this honoured ceremony of our
      fathers would have been more complete, and that my brother the commander
      would have brought with him my good brother Elzear. But that is not to be
      thought of for this night at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord grant that the commander may arrive soon with his black galley,&rdquo;
       said one of the ladies to the baron. &ldquo;These wicked pirates, whom we all
      dread, would not dare make a descent if they knew he was in port.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
      pirates to the devil, good cousin!&rdquo; cried the baron, gaily. &ldquo;The watchman
      is spying them from the height of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle; at his first signal all
      the coast will be in arms. The port of La Ciotat is armed; the citizens
      and fishermen are keeping Christmas with only one hand, they have the
      other on their muskets; my cannon and small guns are loaded, and ready to
      fire on the entrance to the port, if these sea-robbers dare show
      themselves. Manjour! my guests and cousins, if I had obeyed the Marshal of
      Vitry, at this hour my house would be disarmed and out of condition to
      defend the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did very bravely, baron,&rdquo; said the lord of Signerol, &ldquo;to act as
      you did. Now the example has been given and the marshal will meddle no
      longer with our affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manjour! I hope so indeed. If he does, we will meddle with his,&rdquo; said the
      baron. &ldquo;But where is my young comrade of the <i>cachofué?</i>&rdquo; added he.
      &ldquo;I am the eldest, but I must have the youngest to go for the Christmas
      log.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the dear child, father,&rdquo; said Reine, leading a beautiful boy of
      six years, with large blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and lovely curls, up to the
      baron. His mother, a cousin of the baron, looked at the boy with pride,
      not unmixed with fear, for she suspected that he might not be equal to the
      complicated rôle necessary to be played in this patriarchal ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you understand what is to be done, my little Cæsar?&rdquo; asked
      the baron, bending over the little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, monseigneur. Last year, at grandfather&rsquo;s house, I carried the
      Christmas log,&rdquo; replied the child, with a capable and resolute air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The linnet will become a hawk, I promise you, my cousin,&rdquo; said the baron
      to the mother, delighted with the child&rsquo;s self-confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. then took the little fellow by the hand, and, followed by his
      guests, he descended to the door of Maison-Forte, which opened into the
      inner court, before beginning the ceremony of the <i>cachofué</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the inmates and dependents of the castle, labourers, farmers,
      fishermen, vine-dressers, servants, women, children, and old men, were
      assembled in the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the light of the moon was quite bright, a large number of
      torches, made of resinous wood fastened to poles, illuminated the court
      and the interior buildings of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the court were collected the combustibles necessary to
      kindle an immense pile of wood, which was to be set on fire the same
      moment that the <i>cachofué</i> in the hall of the dais was lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. appeared before the assembly attended by four lackeys in
      livery, who walked before him, bearing candlesticks with white wax
      candles. He was followed by his family and his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of the baron, cries of &ldquo;Long live monseigneur!&rdquo; resounded on
      all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the door on the ground lay a large olive-tree, the trunk and
      branches. It was the Christmas log.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbé Mascarolus, in cassock and surplice, commenced the ceremony by
      blessing the Christmas log, or the <i>calignaou</i>, as it was called in
      the Provençal language; then the child approached, followed by Laramée,
      who, in his costume of majordomo, bore on a silver tray a gold cup filled
      with wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child took the cup in his little hands and poured, three times, a few
      drops of wine on the <i>calignaou</i>, or Christmas log, and recited, in a
      sweet and silvery voice, the old Provençal verse, always said upon this
      solemn occasion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;Allègre, Diou nous allègre,

     Cachofué ven, tou ben ven,

     Diou nous fague la grace de veire l&rsquo;an que ven,

     Se si an pas mai, que signen pas men.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, let us be joyful, God gives us all joy;

     Cachofué comes, and it comes all to bless;

     God grant we may live to see the New Year;

     But if we are no more, may we never be less!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These innocent words, recited by the child with charming grace, were
      listened to with religious solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the child wet his lips with the wine in the cup, and presented it to
      Raimond V., who did likewise, and the cup passed from hand to hand, among
      all the members of the baron&rsquo;s family, until each one had wet his lips
      with the consecrated beverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then twelve foresters in holiday dress lifted the calignaou, and carried
      it into the hall of the dais, while, in conformity to the law of the
      ceremony, Raimond V. held in his hand one of the roots of the tree, and
      the child held one of the branches; the old man saying, &ldquo;Black roots are
      old age,&rdquo; and the child answering, &ldquo;Green branches are youth,&rdquo; and the
      assistants adding in chorus, &ldquo;God bless us all, who love him and serve
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The log, borne into the hall on the robust shoulders of the foresters, was
      placed in the immense fireplace, whereupon the child took a pine torch,
      and held it to a pile of fir-apples and boughs; a tall white flame
      sparkled in the vast, black hearth, and threw a joyous radiance to the
      farther end of the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas, Christmas!&rdquo; cried the guests of the baron, clapping their
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas! Christmas!&rdquo; repeated the vassals assembled in the interior
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, the pile of wood outside was kindled, and the tall
      yellow flames mounted in the midst of enthusiastic shouts, and whirls of a
      Provençal dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other last ceremony was to take place, and then the guests would
      gather around the supper-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine advanced to the cradle, and Stephanette brought to her a wooden bowl
      filled with the corn of St. Barbara, which was already green. For it was
      the custom in Provence, every fourth of December, St Barbara&rsquo;s day, to sow
      grains of corn in a porringer filled with earth frequently watered. This
      wet earth was exposed to a very high temperature, and the com grew
      rapidly. If it was green, it predicted a good harvest, if it was yellow,
      the harvest would be bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mlle, des Anbiez placed the wooden bowl at the foot of the cradle, and on
      each side of this offering lit two little square silver lamps, called in
      the Provençal tongue the lamps of Calenos, or Christmas lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St Barbara&rsquo;s corn, green; fine harvests all the year!&rdquo; cried the baron:
      &ldquo;so may my harvests and your harvests be, my guests and cousins! Now to
      the table, yes, to the table, friends, and then come the Christmas
      presents for friends and relations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Laramée opened the folding doors which led to the dining-room, and
      announced supper. It is needless to speak of the abundance of this meal,
      worthy in every respect of the hospitality of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, however, we must not fail to remark, is that there were three
      table-cloths, in conformity to another ancient custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the smallest, which was in the middle of the table, in the style of a
      centre-piece, were the presents of fruits and cakes that the members of
      the family made to their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second, a little larger and lapping over the first, were arranged
      the national dishes of the simplest character, such as bouillabaisse, a
      fish-soup, famous in Provence, and broiled salt tunny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, on the third cloth, which covered the rest of the table, were the
      choicest dishes in abundance, and artistically arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will leave the guests of Raimond V. to the enjoyment of a patriarchal
      hospitality as they discussed old customs, and grew excited over arguments
      relating to freedom and ancient privileges, always so respected and so
      valiantly defended by those who remain faithful to the pathetic and
      religious traditions of the olden time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That happy, peaceful evening was but too soon interrupted by the events to
      which we will now introduce the reader.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. THE ARREST
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Raimond V. and his guests were supping gaily, the company of
      soldiers seen by the watchman, about fifty men belonging to the regiment
      of Guitry, had arrived almost at the door of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recorder Isnard, followed by his clerk, as usual, said to Captain
      Georges, who commanded the detachment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be prudent, captain, to try a summons before attacking by force,
      in order to take possession of the person of Raimond V. There are about
      fifty well-armed men in his lair behind good walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what matters the walls to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, besides the walls, there is a bridge, and you see, captain, it is
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what do I care for the bridge? If Raimond V. refuses to lower it&mdash;ah,
      well, zounds! my carabineers will assault the place; that happened more
      than once in the last war! If necessary, we will attach a petard to the
      door, but let it be understood, recorder, that, whatever happens, you are
      to follow us to make an official report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! hum!&rdquo; grunted the man of law. &ldquo;Without doubt, I and my clerk must
      assist you; I shall be able, even under that circumstance, to note the
      good conduct and zeal of the aforesaid clerk in charging him with this
      honourable mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Master Isnard, that is your office, and not mine!&rdquo; said the unhappy
      clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, my clerk, we are here before Maison-Forte. The moments are
      precious. Do you prepare to follow the captain and obey me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The company had, in fact, reached the end of the sycamore walk, which
      bordered the half-circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridge was up, and the windows opening on the interior court were
      brilliant with light, as the baron&rsquo;s guests had departed but a little
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, captain, the bridge is up, and more, the moat is wide and deep,
      and full of water,&rdquo; said the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Georges carefully examined the entrances of the place; after a few
      moments of silence, he pulled his moustache on the left side violently,&mdash;a
      sure sign of his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sentinel, standing inside the court, seeing the glitter of arms in the
      moonlight, cried, in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who goes there? Answer, or I will fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recorder jumped back three steps, hid himself behind the captain, and
      replied, in a high voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of the king and the cardinal, I, Master Isnard, recorder of
      the admiralty of Toulon, command you to lower this bridge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not depart?&rdquo; said the voice. At the same time a light shone from
      one of the loopholes for guns which defended the entrance. It was easy to
      judge that the sentinel was blowing the match of his musket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; cried Isnard. &ldquo;Your master will be held responsible for what
      you are going to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This warning made the soldier reflect; he fired his musket in the air, at
      the same time crying the word of alarm in a stentorian voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has fired on the king&rsquo;s soldiers!&rdquo; cried the recorder, pale with anger
      and fright &ldquo;It is an act of armed rebellion. I saw it. Clerk, make a note
      of that act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, recorder,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;he has barked, but he has not desired
      to murder. I saw the light, too, and he fired in the air to give the
      alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the sentinel&rsquo;s cries, several lights appeared above the
      walls; numerous precipitate steps, and a great clang of arms were heard in
      the court At last, Master Laramée, a helmet on his head and his breast
      armed with a cuirass, appeared at one of the embrasures of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God, what do you want?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Is this the time, pray,
      to come here and trouble good people who are keeping Christmas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have an order from the king which we come to put into execution,&rdquo; said
      the recorder, &ldquo;and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some wine left yet in my glass, recorder; good evening, I am going
      to empty it,&rdquo; said Laramée, &ldquo;only, remember the bulls, and know that a
      musket-ball reaches farther than their horns. So, now, good-night,
      recorder!&rdquo; &ldquo;Think well on what you are going to do, insolent scoundrel,&rdquo;
       said Captain Georges; &ldquo;you are not dealing this time with a wet hen of a
      recorder, but with a fight-ing-cock, who has a hard beak and sharp spurs,
      I warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Master Isnard,&rdquo; said the clerk, humbly, to the recorder, &ldquo;we
      are to this soldier what a pumpkin is to an artillery ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recorder, already very much offended by the captain&rsquo;s comparison,
      rudely repulsed the clerk, and, addressing Laramée with great importance,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have this time, at your door, the right and the power, the hand and
      the sword of justice. So, majordomo, I order you to open and to lower the
      bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A well-known voice interrupted the recorder; it was that of Raimond V.,
      who had been informed of the arrival of the captain. Escorted by Laramée,
      who carried a torch, the old gentleman appeared erect upon the little
      platform that formed the entablature of the gate masked by the drawbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fluctuating light of the torch threw red reflections on the group of
      soldiers, and shone upon their steel collars and iron head-pieces; half of
      the scene being in the shade or lighted by the rays of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. wore his holiday attire, richly braided with gold, and his
      white hair fell over his lace collar. Nothing was more dignified, more
      imposing or manly than his attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said he, in a sonorous voice. Master Isnard repeated
      the formula of his speech, and concluded by declaring that Raimond V.,
      Baron des Anbiez, was arrested, and would be conducted under a safe escort
      to the prison of the provost of Marseilles, for the crime of rebellion
      against the orders of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron listened to the recorder in profound silence. When the man of
      law had finished, cries of indignation, howls, and threats, uttered by the
      dependents of the baron, resounded through the interior court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. turned around, commanded silence, and replied to the recorder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wished to visit my castle illegally, and to exercise in it an
      authority contrary to the rights of the Provençal nobility. I drove you
      away with my whip. I did what I ought to have done. Now, Manjour! I cannot
      allow myself to be arrested for having done what I ought to have done in
      chastising a villain of your species. Now, execute the orders with which
      you are charged,&mdash;I will not prevent you, any more than I prevented
      your visit to my magazine of artillery. I regret the departure of my
      guests, for they also, in their name, would have protested against the
      oppression of the tyranny of Marseilles.&rdquo; This speech from the baron was
      welcomed with cries of joy by the garrison of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. was about to descend from his pedestal when Captain Georges,
      who had the rough language and abrupt manners of an old soldier, advanced
      on the other side of the moat; he took his hat in his hand, and said to
      Raimond V., in a respectful tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, I must inform you of one thing, which is, that I have with
      me fifty determined soldiers, and that I am resolved, though to my regret,
      to execute my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Execute them, my brave friend,&rdquo; said the baron, smiling, with a jocose
      manner, &ldquo;execute them. Your marshal wishes to know if my powder is good;
      he instructs you to be the gunpowder prover. We will begin the trial
      whenever you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, this is too much parley,&rdquo; cried the recorder. &ldquo;I order you this
      instant to employ force of arms to take possession of this rebel against
      the commands of the king, our master, and to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recorder, I have no orders to receive from you; only take care not to put
      yourself between the lance and the cuirass,&mdash;you might come to
      grief,&rdquo; said the captain, imperiously, to Master Isnard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to the baron, he said, with as much firmness as deference:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last time, monseigneur, I beseech you to consider well: the blood
      of your vassals will flow; you are going to kill old soldiers who have no
      animosity against you or yours, and all that, monseigneur,&mdash;permit an
      old graybeard to speak to you frankly,&mdash;all that because you wish to
      rebel against the orders of the king. May God forgive you, monseigneur,
      for causing the death of so many brave men, and me, for drawing the sword
      against one of the most worthy gentlemen of the province; but I am a
      soldier, and I must obey the orders I have received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This simple and noble language made a profound impression on Raimond V. He
      bowed his head in silence, remained thoughtful for some minutes, then he
      descended from the platform. Murmurs inside were distinctly heard,
      dominated by the ringing voice of the baron. At the same instant the
      bridge was lowered and the gate opened; Raimond V. appeared, and said to
      the captain, as he offered his hand with a dignified and cordial air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter, sir, enter; you are a brave and honest soldier. Although my head
      is white, it is sometimes as foolish as a boy&rsquo;s. I was wrong. It is true,
      you must obey the orders which have been given to you. It is not to you,
      it is to the Marshal of Vitry that I should express my opinion of his
      conduct toward the Provençal nobility. These brave men ought not to be the
      victims of my resistance. To-morrow at the break of day, if you will, we
      will depart for Marseilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the captain, pressing the hand of Raimond V. with
      emotion, and bowing with respect, &ldquo;it is now that I really despair of the
      mission that I am to fulfil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron was about to reply to the captain when a distant, but dreadful
      noise rose on the air, attracting the attention of all those who filled
      the court of Maison-Forte. It was like the hollow roar of the sea in its
      fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a tremendous light illuminated the horizon in the direction of La
      Ciotat, and the bells of the convent and the church began to sound the
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first idea that entered the baron&rsquo;s mind was that the city was on
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;La Ciotat is on fire! Captain, you have my word, I am
      your prisoner, but let us run to the city. You with your soldiers, I with
      my people, we can be useful there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your orders, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the prolonged, reverberating sound of artillery made the
      shore tremble with its echoes, and shook the windows of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannon! Those are the pirates! The watchman to the devil for allowing us
      to be surprised! The pirates! To arms, captain! to arms! These demons are
      attacking the city. Laramée, my sword! Captain, to horse! to horse! You
      can take me prisoner to-morrow, but to-night let us run to defend this
      unfortunate city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monseigneur, your house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take them if they venture here! Laramée and twenty men could
      defend it against an entire army. But this unfortunate city is surprised.
      Quick! to horse! to horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roar of the artillery became more and more frequent. All the bells
      were ringing,&mdash;a deep rumbling sound reached as far as Maison-Forte,&mdash;and
      the flames increased in number and intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laramée, in all haste, brought the baron&rsquo;s helmet and cuirass. Raimond V.
      took the helmet, but would not hear of the cuirass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manjour! what time have I to fasten that paraphernalia? Quick, bring
      Mistraon to me,&rdquo; cried he, running to the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Mistraon bridled, but, seeing that it required some time to
      saddle him, he mounted the horse barebacked, told Laramée to keep twenty
      men for the defence of Maison-Forte, commended his daughter to his care,
      and took, in hot haste, the road to La Ciotat.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. THE DESCENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the baron and the captain approached the city, they saw the whirlwind
      of flames more distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells continued to ring at random; a thousand cries, more or less
      distinct, mingled with the bursts of musketry and the roar of artillery
      from the galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived behind the walls of the Ursuline convent, situated at
      the extreme end of the city, Raimond V. said: &ldquo;Captain, let us halt here a
      moment to collect our people and agree upon operations. Manjour! I feel
      young again; the blood thickens in my veins. I have not felt that since
      the wars of Piedmont; it is because a pirate is worse than a foreigner,
      and in the civil wars, a man&rsquo;s heart is oppressed in spite of himself.
      Silence!&rdquo; said the baron to his troops as he turned around. &ldquo;Let us hear
      where the firing comes from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After listening closely for some minutes, he said to the captain: &ldquo;Will
      you listen to my counsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow your orders, monseigneur, for I am not well acquainted with
      La Ciotat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing one of his men, Raimond V. said: &ldquo;Do you conduct the
      captain and his soldiers to the port, going around the city so as not to
      be seen. When you are there, captain, if there are any more demons to
      land, you will drive them back to their galleys; if they have all
      disembarked, do you wait until they return, so as to cut off their
      retreat; during that time, I will try to beat them up for you like a herd
      of wild boars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what part of the city do you think they are, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can judge by the noise of the musketry, they are in the
      town-hall square, occupied in plundering the houses of the richest
      citizens. They will not dare venture farther in, as no doubt they are in
      communication with the port by a little street which goes from that place
      to the wharf. So, then, captain, to the port,&mdash;to the port! let us
      rather throw these villains back into the sea, than into their vessels. If
      God gives me life I will expect you at Maison-Forte after the affair, for
      I do not forget that I am your prisoner. To the port, captain! to the
      port!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count on me, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the captain, hastening his march in the
      direction indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my children,&rdquo; said the baron, &ldquo;keep silence, and let us hurry to the
      town hall, and put all these brigands to the sword. Our Lady! and
      forward!&rdquo; Raimond V. then descended from his horse, and entered the
      streets of La Ciotat at the head of a determined body of men, full of
      confidence in their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Raimond V. approached the centre of action, he recognised, here and
      there, women who uttered heartrending cries, as they ran in the direction
      of the mountain, followed by their weeping children, and carrying on their
      heads their most precious possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other places, priests and distracted monks, seized with the panic of
      terror, had left their houses, where they were peaceably keeping
      Christmas, and were running to throw themselves at the foot of the church
      altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many deserted streets, armed men stood at their windows, resolved to
      defend their houses and their families to the utmost, and were thoroughly
      prepared to give the pirates a vigorous reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouds of sparks and cinders were encountered by the resolute troops as
      they steadily marched, and the whirling flames made the streets they
      crossed as bright as broad day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they reached the square, and, as the baron had foreseen, the
      principal action was on that side of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirates rarely ventured into the streets remote from the coast, for
      fear of being cut off from their vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to paint the spectacle which struck Raimond V. with
      horror. By the light of the dazzling flames, he saw a part of the pirates
      engaged in a bloody combat with a number of fishermen and citizens
      entrenched in the upper story of the town hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other corsairs, thinking only of plunder,&mdash;these belonged to the
      galley of Trimalcyon,&mdash;ran like so many demons across the
      conflagration they had kindled, some laden with costly articles, and
      others bearing in their robust arms women and young girls, who uttered
      shrieks of agony and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground was already strewn with bodies riddled with wounds, unfortunate
      victims who at least bore testimony to a desperate resistance on the part
      of the inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the middle of the square, and not far from the little street which
      conducted to the port, could be seen a confused mass of all sorts of
      objects guarded by two Moors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirates increased this pile of plunder every moment, by coming there
      and throwing down additional booty, then returning to pillage and murder
      with renewed ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of brave sailors and citizens, who were defending themselves in
      the town hall, began to diminish sensibly under the blows of the spahis of
      Pog, who thirsted far more for blood than for pillage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with a hatchet, Pog attacked the door with fury, voluntarily
      exposing his life. He wore neither helmet nor cuirass, and was only
      clothed in his yellek of black velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the height of this attack Raimond V. arrived on the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      His troops announced their presence by a general discharge of musketry on
      the assailants of the town hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirates, attacked unawares, turned and threw themselves in a rage
      against the soldiers of the baron. Each side then abandoned firearms. A
      hand to hand struggle ensued; the conflict became bloody, terrible beyond
      words to describe. The band of Trimalcyon, seeing this unexpected
      reinforcement, left their pillage and rallied around Fog&rsquo;s pirates,
      surrounding the little company of Raimond V., who was performing prodigies
      of valour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman seemed to recover the strength of the years of his
      youth. Armed with a heavy boar-spear, which was provided with a sharp and
      well-tempered bayonet, he employed this murderous weapon, both lance and
      club, with tremendous power, and although his helmet was broken in several
      places and his sword-belt covered with blood, Raimond V., in his
      enthusiasm as a warrior, did not feel his wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carried along on the wave of battle, Pog suddenly found himself face to
      face with the baron. His pale, haughty face, his long red beard, were too
      conspicuous not to have made a lively impression on Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recognised in this pirate one of the two strangers who accompanied
      Erebus, at the time of the meeting in the gorges of Ollioules.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Muscovite who accompanied the brave young man to whom I owe my
      life,&rdquo; cried Raimond V.; then he added, as he lifted his spear: &ldquo;Ah! wild
      bear, you come from the ice of the north to ravage our provinces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words Raimond V. aimed a terrible blow full in the breast.
      Pog avoided the blow by a quick movement in retreat, but his arm was run
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Frenchman, like you,&rdquo; cried the renegade, with a brutal sneer,
      &ldquo;and it is French blood for which I thirst! That your death may be more
      bitter, know that your daughter is in my power!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these terrible words, the baron stood for a moment, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog profited by his inaction to strike him a terrible blow on the head
      with his battle-axe. The baron&rsquo;s helmet had already been broken; he
      staggered a moment like a drunken man, then fell unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another one of these Provençal bulls killed!&rdquo; cried Pog, brandishing his
      battle-axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us avenge our lord!&rdquo; cried the people of Raimond V., hurling
      themselves at the pirates with such fury that they drove them back into
      the little street which led to the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, reinforced by the sailors who had been besieged in the town hall,
      and whom the attack of Raimond V. had just delivered, they had such a
      decided advantage over the pirates, that the trumpets of the latter
      sounded a retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this signal, a part of the brigands formed in good order in the middle
      of the square, under the command of Pog. Then they made a vigorous
      resistance so as to give the other pirates time to transport their booty
      on board the galleys, and to drag to these vessels the men and women they
      had captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remaining master of the position that he had defended, Pog covered the
      entrance of the little street leading to the port, and thus assured the
      retreat of the band of Trimalcyon, occupied in dragging the captives on
      board the galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, yielding the ground to his enemies, foot by foot, fell back into the
      little street, sure that his communication with the port and the galleys
      could not be intercepted, and that he could effect his reëmbarkation
      without danger. The street was so narrow that twenty determined men could
      defend it against ten times the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumour of the pirates&rsquo; retreat was spread through the city, and all
      the inhabitants who, entrenched in their houses, either from fear or a
      desire to watch over their dearest interests, had not dared to venture
      out, now rushed into the streets and joined the combatants, whose number
      increased in proportion as that of the pirates diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, although wounded in the head and arm, continued his retreat with rare
      intrepidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only a few steps from what he believed to be a place of safety. It
      proved to be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freebooters, who had directed their steps toward the port, in order to
      regain their galleys, fell into the ambuscade of Captain Georges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vigorously attacked by these fresh troops, the pirates fell into disorder
      in the little street, at the very moment when Pog entered it at the
      opposite end. Thus, caught in this narrow way, the two outlets of which
      were obstructed by assailants, the pirates found themselves between two
      fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the side of the square they were attacked by the baron&rsquo;s troops; from
      the side of the port, by the carabineers of Captain Georges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trimalcyon remained on board his galley, having that of Pog temporarily
      under his orders. At some distance from the quay, he awaited the return of
      the long-boats, which were to bring on board the booty and the pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of their number, throwing himself in the water, went to inform him of
      the danger which threatened his companions. Then Trimalcyon resorted to
      extreme measures. He had the irons removed from a part of the crew, armed
      them, and approached his galleys so near the quay that their beak-heads
      served as a landing-place, and at the head of this reinforcement, he,
      uttering a wild cry, threw himself upon the soldiers of Captain Georges,
      who in his turn found himself between two fires. Fog&rsquo;s company, which had
      kept the street, sure of being supported, made a last effort against the
      carabineers, already attacked behind by Trimalcyon, cut their way through,
      operating in union with Trimalcyon&rsquo;s men, and after a great loss,
      succeeded in gaining their vessels, carrying with them several prisoners,
      among whom were Master Isnard and his clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boldest of the sailors and citizens, and almost all of the carabineers
      of Captain Georges, jumped into their boats to pursue the pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the advantage was on the side of the galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their ten pieces of artillery struck the boats which tried to approach
      them. Then the galley, by vigorous use of oars, rapidly gained the outlet
      of the port, and prepared to double the point of Verte Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog was standing in the stem of the Red Galleon; he was pale, his hair and
      his clothes were full of blood; he threw a look of sullen triumph on the
      flames which continued to rise in the centre of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a cannon-shot resounded; a ball whistled above his head, and
      carried off a part of his galley&rsquo;s stem. He turned around quickly. A
      second ball killed four of the galley-slaves and tore away the first seat
      of the rowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a little cloud of whitish smoke which crowned the embattled terrace of
      Maison-Forte, that could be seen in the distance by moonlight, the pirate
      recognised the spot whence these projectiles were sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his acquaintance with the habits of war, he perceived, from the great
      distance at which these missiles were fired, that they must have been shot
      by a culverin of large calibre, and consequently he could not return the
      fire, as the artillery of the <i>Red Galleon</i> was unable to carry to
      such a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      These first shots were followed by several others, not less happy, which
      caused considerable damage either on board the <i>Red Galleon</i> or the
      <i>Sybarite</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell and damnation!&rdquo; cried Pog. &ldquo;So long as we do not double the point of
      the bay, we will be under the fire of that hovel! Ply your oars faster,
      dogs,&rdquo; cried he, addressing the crew. &ldquo;Ply your oars faster, I tell you,
      or when I reach Tripoli, I will have your arms cut off to the shoulder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crew had no need of that encouragement to redouble their efforts; the
      dead bodies of slaves killed by the cannon-balls, and still chained to the
      benches where their companions were rowing, proved to them the danger of
      remaining under the fire of that murderous culverin.
    </p>
    <p>
      That piece, however, continued to aim with such marvellous accuracy, that
      it sent several balls on board the two galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death and fury!&rdquo; cried Pog, &ldquo;once out of this channel I will go and
      anchor at the foot of the rocks within half-range of the musket, and there
      shall not remain one stone on another of the house where that culverin is
      in battery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, Captain Pog,&rdquo; said a Frenchman, a renegade Provençal, who
      served as pilot. &ldquo;The Black Rocks extend between wind and water more than
      half a league from the coast, and you would be sure to lose your galley,
      if you tried to come nearer to Maison-Forte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pirate made a gesture of rage, and promenaded the deck in great
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the two galleys got out of the dangerous pass where they had been
      caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artillery of Maison-Forte had disabled many men, and had damaged them
      to such a degree that they would be compelled to anchor promptly in some
      harbour on the coast, before they would be able to set sail for Tripoli.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Sybarite</i> had received several shots below her water-line, and
      the <i>Red Galleon</i> had her tree cut in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had doubled the promontory of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle, the master carpenter
      of the galley, a renegade Calabrian, a good sailor and a man of great
      courage, came forward with a solemn air to Pog-Reis, and said: &ldquo;Captain, I
      have daubed as much as I possibly can the damages in the peel, but they
      are too large, and a thorough refitting is absolutely necessary, for if we
      have stormy weather, we will not stand the sea two hours with such
      injuries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog made no reply, but continued walking the deck with agitation; then he
      called the pilot and said to him: &ldquo;Can we not anchor a day or two in the
      islands of Ste. Marguerite or St Honorât? They say these islands are not
      armed. You left the coast a year ago; is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; answered the pilot &ldquo;There ought to be good anchorage in the
      isles of Pieres and St. Feriol, on the windward of St. Honorât?&rdquo; asked
      Pog, who was acquainted with these islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain, the coast is so high, and the harbour so protected by the
      rocks which form these islands, that the galleys will be hidden better
      there than at Port-Cros.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are not, I believe, fifty inhabitants on the island?&rdquo; asked Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more, captain, and twenty men at the outside; there is besides a very
      convenient shore for careening the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then steer for those islands; we ought to be about twenty-five leagues
      distant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty leagues, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a great deal for the damage we have sustained, but it is,
      however, our surest place to put in. We will be there in a day if the wind
      is favourable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The galley of Trimalcyon, as well as the chebec, followed the manoeuvres
      of the <i>Red Galleon</i>, and the three vessels crowded sail toward the
      island of St Honorât, situated on the coast of Provence, a short distance
      from Cannes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These orders given, Pog estimated the losses sustained by his crew; they
      were quite numerous. Sixteen soldiers had been killed in La Ciotat, and
      there were a great many wounded men on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the culverin of Maison-Forte had, as we have seen, killed four of
      the galley-slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They unchained the bodies and threw them into the sea, and replaced them
      with five soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wounded were more or less cared for by a Moor, who performed the
      functions of surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog had two wounds; one in the head, the other in the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron&rsquo;s spear had given this last wound, which was very deep, but the
      one in his head was comparatively insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor who discharged the duties of surgeon had just completed the first
      dressing of these wounds, when the chebec of Erebus, under full sail,
      approached the galley of Pog, and ranged herself within reach of his
      voice.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. THE CHEBEC
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will now retrace our steps in order to inform the reader what were the
      manoeuvres of this chebec, during the attack on La Ciotat, in which it
      took no part. We will also tell how Reine des Anbiez fell into the power
      of Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, after having put the watchman to sleep by means of a
      narcotic, descended to the shore, and reached the point of land behind
      which the galleys and the chebec of the pirates awaited his arrival,
      conformable to the instructions he had sent to Pog-Reis by a second
      pigeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji, in spite of the cold, bravely plunged into the water and soon
      reached the <i>Red Galleon</i>, which was resting on her oars a little
      distance from the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long conversation with Pog-Reis, to whom he gave the necessary
      information to assure the success of his descent upon La Ciotat, the
      Bohemian, following the orders of Pog, returned on board the chebec
      commanded by Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vessel was to take no part in the action, but was to approach
      Maison-Forte in order to assist in the abduction of Reine des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the young girl was in the power of Erebus, the chebec had the
      order, to give the signal, upon which the galleys of the pirates would
      begin their attack upon the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the combat the chebec was to serve as light-ship and cruiser at
      large, so as to give the alarm to the pirates if by chance the royal
      galleys of the Duke de Brézé appeared in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      These plans agreed upon, the chebec, separating herself from the galleys,
      and doubling the promontory, under the guidance of the Bohemian, who was
      well acquainted with the localities, advanced toward the belt of rocks
      which extended at the foot of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a consequence of his conversation with Pog the day before, Erebus had
      taken a fit of the most profound sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of those frequent and bitter moments of introspection, he had seen
      his conduct in its true light; he was moved to pity as he thought of the
      misfortunes soon to befall this defenceless city, and when the posts of
      action were being distributed, he had formally declared to Pog that he
      would take no part in this new deed of robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, who always urged him to evil, did not oppose this resolution, but
      even encouraged it, and advised Erebus to take advantage of this
      opportunity to abduct Mile, des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a necessary sequence he left him all liberty of manoeuvre to execute
      this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus accepted; he had his designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his first singular meeting with Reine, since, especially, the report
      of Hadji had made him believe that he was loved, his passion for the young
      girl had increased with each day of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, in praising to him the sweetness, the charms, the mind, and
      the loftiness of character possessed by Mlle, des Anbiez, had aroused in
      his soul the noblest although the most undefined hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His last conversation with Pog decided him to risk everything to realise
      those hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had often heard Pog give vent to his cruel misanthropy, but never had
      the wickedness of the man, the baseness of the motives which instigated
      and controlled his actions, been so revealed, and finding he was not bound
      to him by any tie which demanded his respect, he resolved to avail himself
      of the first opportunity which offered to escape his influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He affected, then, some hours before the enterprise which was designed to
      lay La Ciotat in ruins, a brutal and licentious gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog was, or appeared to be, the dupe of these demonstrations. As we have
      said, he gave Erebus entire liberty to conduct the abduction of Reine, and
      Erebus, eager to profit from this permission, confided his plans to Hadji,
      from whom he received valuable suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless his action was criminal, but the unhappy young man, reared, as
      we may say, outside the pale of society, knowing only the intensity of his
      own desires, loving passionately and believing himself not less
      passionately loved, could not hesitate a moment before this determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they came in sight of Maison-Forte, the chebec lay to, and
      Erebus descended into a small boat with Hadji and four capable rowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian had profited from his sojourn on the coast, and thus directed
      the little craft across the reefs and quicksands until it was moored under
      the shelter of a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the guests of Raimond V. had just left him, the Christmas
      feast being ended, and the recorder Isnard, assisted by Captain Georges,
      had not arrived to arrest the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus, Hadji, and the four rowers landed and cautiously advanced to the
      foot of the embattled walls of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that the Bohemian had often scaled these walls in
      order to exhibit his agility before the eyes of Stephanette and Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was shining, but the shadow projected by the massive buildings of
      Maison-Forte had covered the descent and march of the six pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sentinel who promenaded the terrace perceived nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows in the gallery of the castle flamed with light, but those
      belonging to Reine&rsquo;s oratory were dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji thought very naturally that Mlle, des Anbiez had not yet retired to
      her apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proposed to Erebus to wait until Reine should return to her oratory,
      then scale the wall, stab the sentinel, and, once masters of the terrace,
      climb up to the balcony as he had often done during his stay at
      Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window could be broken open, and the cries of Mlle, des Anbiez could
      be stifled by gagging her. The descent from the window to the terrace was
      comparatively easy, and from the terrace to the rocks. The girl could be
      carried down by mean of a sort of girdle, contrived for the landing or
      embarking of recalcitrant slaves, with which the Bohemian was
      provisionally furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case of alarm, the pirates relied upon their address and intrepidity to
      make good their escape to the boat before the inmates of Maison-Forte
      could reach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was accepted by Erebus, who only opposed the murder of the
      sentinel. To that he would not give his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four pirates then prepared to scale the walls, leaving two rowers in
      the boat. The sentinel was walking on the side opposite to that on which
      they intended to climb to the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji, followed by one of his companions, climbed the wall with the aid of
      holes which time had worn, and the long branches of ivy which had taken
      root in the hollows of the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the summit of the wall, the pirates perceived, to their
      great joy, that the sentry-box stood between them and the sentinel, and
      thus hid them from his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment was critical. They leaped upon the platform of the
      fortification. At the instant in which the soldier in his regular march
      returned to the sentry-box, Hadji and his companion threw themselves on
      him with the rapidity of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji placed his two hands over the sentinel&rsquo;s mouth, while his companion
      seized his musket; then, by the aid of a gag, called by the pirates a tap,
      with which the Bohemian was provided, they soon stopped his cries, and
      fastened his limbs firmly with a long cotton cloth, which they wound
      around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hadji threw a rope ladder to Erebus, who in a moment mounted to the
      terrace. It was then about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji knew that the post would not be relieved until two o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a light shone from the windows of Reine&rsquo;s oratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hidden in the shadow of the sentry-box, Hadji and Erebus deliberated a
      moment upon what they must do, to accomplish their purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian proposed to scale the balcony alone, as its length exceeded
      by far the breadth of the window-casement, and there to hide and spy
      through the glass panes, in order to learn the most propitious moment for
      acting, which he would signify to Erebus by a sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter adopted the plan, but insisted upon taking part in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji climbed up the first, threw the rope ladder to Erebus, and both lay
      in ambuscade on each side of the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus was just about to look through the panes, when the window-blinds,
      which were on the outside, opened softly, and Reine walked out on the
      balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Erebus and Hadji found themselves concealed from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl, sad and anxious, wished to enjoy for awhile the beauty of
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was precious, and the opportunity favourable, and the same idea
      entered the minds of the Bohemian and Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly closing the window-blinds behind Reine, they seized her before she
      was able to utter a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine her fright, her anguish, when she recognised in her ravisher the
      stranger of the rocks of Ollioules!
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus, in the feeble struggle which occurred between him and the unhappy
      girl, employed every possible means to prevent violence or injury to the
      one he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less time than it requires to write it, Mlle, des Anbiez was surrounded
      with the girdle, which rendered her incapable of movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus, not able to use his hands in descending the rope ladder, since he
      carried Reine in his arms, made Hadji fasten a rope around his body; as he
      descended each step of the ladder, the Bohemian let the rope slip softly
      so as to sustain the ravisher; finally, with Reine in his arms, Erebus
      reached the foot of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji, in his turn, was just about to leave the balcony, when Stephanette
      entered the chamber, crying: &ldquo;Mademoiselle! mademoiselle! the recorder and
      his soldiers have come to arrest monseigneur!&rdquo; For at that moment Master
      Isnard and Captain Georges had arrived at the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not finding her mistress in her chamber, and seeing the window open,
      Stephanette ran thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, seeing the danger to which he was exposed by the presence of
      Stephanette, hid himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, astonished not to find her mistress, went out on the balcony.
      The Bohemian softly shut the window behind her, and put his hand over her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although surprised and frightened, Stephanette made bold efforts to
      deliver herself from the pirate, who, scarcely able to hold her, cried in
      a low voice to Erebus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help! This she devil is as strong as a little demon; she bites like
      a wildcat If she cries, all is lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus, not willing to leave Reine, ordered the other pirate to go to the
      help of Hadji.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Stephanette, much more robust than her mistress, and having
      habits calculated to develop her strength, made a heroic and vigorous
      resistance; she even succeeded in making use of her pretty teeth, to make
      Hadji relinquish his prize, and in uttering a few cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the window was closed and her calls for help were not
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second pirate came to the aid of the Bohemian, and, in spite of her
      efforts, the betrothed of the worthy Captain Trinquetaille shared the fate
      of her mistress, and was lowered down to the terrace with much less
      ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gained the platform of the rampart, the enterprise met with no
      other serious difficulty, and the two young girls were carried down the
      length of the wall with the same means and precautions which accomplished
      their descent from the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus and Hadji gained the long-boat which awaited them, and the two
      captives were on board the chebec without a suspicion having entered the
      thought of a single inmate of Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      All, up to that time, had transpired according to the will of Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine and Stephanette, released from their bonds, were respectfully
      deposited in the cabin of the chebec, which Erebus had arranged with the
      most scrupulous care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first feeling of alarm and amazement past, Reine recovered her wonted
      firmness and dignity of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette, on the contrary, after having valiantly resisted, yielded to
      a grief which was nothing less than desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Erebus presented himself, she threw herself on her knees before him,
      weeping in anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine preserved a gloomy silence, and did not deign even to look at her
      captor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus then began to be frightened at the success of his venture. He was
      still under the influence of good and bad instincts which struggled within
      him for mastery. He was not an audacious ravisher; he was a timid child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sullen silence, the dignified and grieved manner of Reine, impressed
      him and pained him at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji, during the whole time of their fatal expedition, had constantly
      repeated to Erebus that Reine loved him passionately, and that the first
      moment of shame and anger past, he would find the young girl full of
      tenderness and even gratitude. Making one courageous effort, he approached
      Reine with an insolent ease of manner and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the storm, the sunshine. To-morrow you will think only of the song
      of the emir, and my love will dry your tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, he tried to take one of Reine&rsquo;s hands, which she
      kept over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch! do not come near me!&rdquo; cried she, repulsing him with horror, and
      looking at him so disdainfully that Erebus did not dare take another step.
    </p>
    <p>
      A veil fell from his eyes. The accent, the emotion, the indignation of
      Reine were so sincere that, in an instant, he lost all hope. He saw, or
      rather believed, that he had been grossly deceived, that the young girl
      had no affection for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his painful surprise, he fell on his knees before Reine and, with
      clasped hands, cried, in a pathetic voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not love me then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, forgive me, forgive me, mademoiselle,&rdquo; continued Erebus, on his
      knees, with his hands clasped, and he added with charming ingenuousness:
      &ldquo;My God! forgive me, I thought you loved me. Ah, well! no, no, do not be
      angry! I believed it,&mdash;the Bohemian told me so; if he had not, I
      should never have done what I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for the gravity of the occasion, one would have laughed to see this
      young pirate, lately so bold, so resolute, trembling and lowering his eyes
      before the angry glance of Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette, struck with this contrast, in spite of her grief, could not
      help saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to hear him, one would think it was the waggish trick of a page,
      about some stolen ribbon or bouquet! Fie, fie, sir, you are a pagan, a
      monster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how dreadful&mdash;how dreadful! And my father, my poor father!&rdquo;
       cried Reine, bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sincere sorrow tore the heart of Erebus; he felt the whole extent of
      his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! for pity&mdash;for pity&rsquo;s sake, do not weep so!&rdquo; cried he, his own
      eyes full of tears. &ldquo;I see my wrongs now. Tell me, what do you wish me to
      do to expiate them? I will do it,&mdash;command me,&rsquo;&mdash;my life is
      yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then send me back to my father, this very instant. My father, my
      father! if he knows of this capture, what a terrible blow for him! It is a
      crime for which you will always have to reproach yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spurn me,&mdash;I deserve it,&mdash;but at least do not forget that I
      saved the life of your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what matters that, since you have saved it only to make him so
      wretched now? I shall think of you henceforth, not to bless you, but to
      curse you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Erebus, rising to his feet. &ldquo;No, you will not curse me!
      You will say, yes, you will soon say that your words have snatched an
      unhappy soul from the abyss which was about to engulf it for ever. Listen
      to me. This city is now happy and peaceful. The pirates are near: let the
      signal be given from this chebec,&mdash;death, pillage, and flames will
      desolate this coast&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God! oh, my father!&rdquo; cried Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take courage, that signal shall not be given. I will save this city. You
      are in my power, and this very hour, I will have you carried back to land.
      Ah, well, then say&mdash;oh, say, if I do that,&rdquo; implored Erebus, with
      profound sadness, &ldquo;will you think of me sometimes without anger and
      without contempt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never thank God, for having restored me to my father, without
      thinking with gratitude of the saviour of the Baron des Anbiez,&rdquo; said
      Reine, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Erebus shall be worthy of your remembrance!&rdquo; cried the young pirate.
      &ldquo;I am going now to prepare for your departure, and I shall return for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up on deck in haste. The chebec was lying to. The two galleys
      could be seen in the distance. Although the chebec belonged to Pog-Reis,
      Erebus had commanded the vessel for three years. He believed that he had
      won the affection of the whole crew. When he reached the deck, he saw
      Hadji in the act of lighting a fuse, the signal agreed upon between Pog
      and Erebus, to announce that Mlle, des Anbiez was on board the chebec, and
      therefore the attack on La Ciotat could begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Erebus to Hadji, &ldquo;do not give the signal yet. For a long time
      you have been devoted to me; today, especially, you have served me
      faithfully. Listen to me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak quickly, Lord Erebus, for Pog-Reis is waiting for the signal, and
      if I delay to give it, he will make me ride the chase-gun on his galley,
      with a ball on each foot to hold me in position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you obey me, you will have nothing to fear. This life of murder and
      robbery is hateful to me; the men that I command are less brutal than
      their companions; they love me; they have confidence in me; I can propose
      to them to abandon the galleys. The chebec is superior to the galleys in
      speed. After the expedition of which I will tell you presently, we will
      set sail for the East,&mdash;the Grecian Archipelago; when we arrive at
      Smyrna, we will put ourselves in the pay of the bey, and instead of being
      pirates, we will become soldiers; instead of cutting the throats of
      merchants on the deck of their vessels, we will fight men. Will you second
      me?&rdquo; Hadji had kept the lighted match in his hand; holding it to his
      mouth, he brightened the flame with imperturbable coolness, and said to
      Erebus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are those all the plans you have, Lord Erebus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are not all. To prevent the new crimes contemplated by Pog-Reis,
      we are going to approach the galleys under full sail, and cry with fright
      that we have just seen, on the horizon, the fires of the king&rsquo;s galleys.
      They know that the galleys of the King of France are at Marseilles, and
      dread their coming, and so will easily believe us. Pog-Reis will take
      flight before these superior forces, and this unfortunate city will
      escape, at least for this time, the horrible fate which threatens it. Ah,
      well, what do you say to my plan? You have influence over the crew, second
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadji blew his match again, looked at Erebus steadily, and for reply,
      before the latter could prevent it, set fire to the fuse which was to
      serve as a signal for the attack of the pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatal light darted into space like a meteor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Erebus, throwing himself on Hadji with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji, with strength superior to that of the young man, wrested himself
      from his hands, and said to him, with mingled irony, respect, and
      affection:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Lord Erebus; neither I nor these brave men have any desire to
      exchange our liberty for the discipline of the bey&rsquo;s soldiers. The sea in
      all its immensity is ours; we would be the proud courser that has the
      limitless desert for his career, rather than the blindfolded horse that
      turns the machinery to draw water from a well. Now the service of beyliks,
      compared to our adventurous life, is nothing more. In a word, we are
      devils, and we are not old enough yet to become hermits, as the Christians
      say. Our trade pleases us. We will not give up liberty for a prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it; you are a hardened villain, I believed you had nobler
      sentiments. But so much the worse for you; the crew is attached to me,
      they will listen to me and will give me a strong hand to get rid of you,
      if you dare oppose my plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Eblis! what are you saying, Lord Erebus?&rdquo; cried the Bohemian, with an
      ironical air. &ldquo;You treat me so, I, who, to serve you, sang to your
      lady-love the song of the emir! I, who demeaned myself to the low trade of
      a tinker! I, who defiled myself by helping Dame Dulceline raise a sort of
      altar to the God of the Christians! I, who, to serve you, set the foot of
      the greyhound belonging to Raimond V. and even consented to shoe the old
      sot&rsquo;s horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, you scoundrel! not a word more of that unhappy father to whom
      I have given such a cruel blow! Reflect well, I am going to speak to the
      crew, whatever it may cost me; there is still time for you to rally to my
      aid and become an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my Lord Erebus; you propose to me to become an honest man. I
      shall reply to you as a poet and a tinker. When for years a thick and
      corrosive rust has accumulated on a copper vase, and this rust has been
      bronzed by fire, you may rub a thousand years and more without giving back
      to this vase its original purity and brilliancy, and at last succeed in
      making it a little less black only than the wings of Eblis! Ah, well! such
      as we, I and my companions, we are bronzed by evil. Do not try to entice
      us to good. You will be neither understood nor obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be understood, perhaps, but I shall be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be obeyed if your orders are contrary to certain
      instructions given by Pog-Reis to the crew before departing from
      Port-Cros.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instructions? You lie like a dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my Lord Erebus,&rdquo; said Hadji, with unalterable coolness; &ldquo;although
      I do not wish to enter into the good road, I love you in my fashion, and I
      would wish to prevent your taking a false step. Pog-Reis, after a certain
      conversation with you, which he told me, distrusts you. A little while
      ago, when on the height of Cape l&rsquo;Aigle, where I put the old watchman to
      sleep, I saw our galleys coming, I descended to the shore and went on
      board the <i>Red Galleon</i>, and there I had a secret conversation about
      you with Pog-Reis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Traitor! why have you concealed that from me?&rdquo; &ldquo;The
      wise man hides three things for every two he tells. Pog-Reis told me he
      had informed the crew, and he did inform me that the orders which he had
      given you were these: carry off the young girl, give a signal that the
      abduction has been successful, then cruise around La Ciotat while the
      galleys are attacking that swarm of fat citizens; lastly, watch that our
      men are not surprised by the galleys of the King of France, coming from
      the west,&mdash;is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, then, Lord Erebus, I tell you that if the orders you are going
      to give are contrary to those, they will not listen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very instant,&rdquo; said Erebus, and turning to the steersman and sailors
      who awaited his orders, he commanded them to make a manoeuvre which would
      bring the chebec nearer to Maison-Forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was his astonishment when, instead of executing his orders, he saw
      the steersman and sailors, at a sign from Hadji, make a contrary
      manoeuvre, which brought the chebec nearer the place of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to obey me!&rdquo; cried Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well! Lord Erebus, what did I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word from you, scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus tried in vain to shake the fidelity of the sailors; whether from
      terror, or the habit of passive obedience, or from the love of their gross
      and licentious life, they remained faithful to the orders they had
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus bowed his head in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are the commander of this chebec,&rdquo; said he to Hadji, with a
      bitter smile, &ldquo;then I address you to have the sails put back, and have the
      long-boat which is in tow brought to the side of the vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the captain here, Lord Erebus; order, without going contrary to
      the commands of Pog-Reis,&mdash;and I will be the first to haul the
      rigging or turn the helm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to words; then have the long-boat manned with four men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring the chebec&rsquo;s sails back? Nothing prevents that,&rdquo; said Hadji. &ldquo;Watch
      is kept as well standing still as moving about, and from time to time the
      sentinel stops. As to manning the long-boat, that will be done when I know
      your intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus stamped his foot impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intention is to conduct these two young girls back to land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw back the pearl of the gulf on a savage coast!&rdquo; cried the Bohemian,
      &ldquo;when she is in your power, when you are loved, when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent and obey! That, I think, is my personal affair, and Pog-Reis
      shall not force me to abduct a woman, if I do not wish to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That abduction is a personal affair to Pog-Reis also, Lord Erebus. I
      cannot order the long-boat to be manned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried the young man, almost in fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis is an old stager, Lord Erebus. He knows that, in spite of his
      strength and courage, the tiger can fall, as well as the stupid buffalo,
      in the snare that the artful trapper has set for his steps. Eblis has
      shaken his wings over La Ciotat; the flames crackle, the cannon thunder,
      the musketry flashes; our people are glutting themselves with pillage and
      putting the Christians in chains,&mdash;that is well. But suppose
      Pog-Reis, suppose Trimalcyon-Reis should be surprised and taken prisoners
      by these dogs of Christians! Suppose our people should be obliged to fly
      back to their galleys and abandon the prisoners, Pog and Trimalcyon, to be
      quartered and burned as renegades&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you finish, say, will you finish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By keeping the pearl of La Ciotat, Reine des Anbiez, as hostage, until
      the end of the enterprise, she can be of great help to us, and be worth to
      us, by her exchange, the liberty of Pog-Reis, or of Trimalcyon-Reis. So,
      then, this young girl and her companion must remain here until Pog-Reis
      has decided their fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus was overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither threats nor entreaties could shake the determination of Hadji, or
      of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, in his despair, he was on the point of throwing himself into
      the sea and swimming to the coast, that he might be killed by the pirates;
      then he remembered that such a course would leave Reine without a
      defender. He descended to the cabin in the gloom of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is our generous saviour,&rdquo; cried Reine, rising and walking up to
      him. Erebus shook his head sadly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now a prisoner like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he related to the two young girls what had just transpired on the
      bridge. One moment calmed by a deceitful assurance, the distress of Reine
      now burst forth with renewed violence, and notwithstanding the repentance
      of Erebus, she accused him, with reason, of being the author of the misery
      which oppressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of affairs on board the chebec, when, now commanded by
      Hadji, since Erebus had joined Reine and Stephanette, it approached the
      galleys of Pog and Trimalcyon, which, by dint of oars, were leaving La
      Ciotat after their fatal expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian stood at the stem of the chebec, when Pog-Reis, hailing it
      from his galley, said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well! is that girl on board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain Pog, and more, there is a linnet with the dove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Erebus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Erebus wanted to do what Captain Pog foresaw,&rdquo; said the Bohemian,
      making an intelligent sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected it Watch him. Keep the command of the chebec, sail in my
      waters, and follow my manoeuvres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be obeyed, Captain Pog. But before parting from you, let me make
      you a present There are the papers and playthings of love belonging to a
      chevalier of Malta. It is, I believe, a story worthy of Ben-Absull. I got
      this treasure-trove from the cabin of the watchman. I thought I had found
      a diamond, and found only a grain of corn. But it may interest you,
      Captain Pog. There is a Maltese cross on the casket; everything which
      bears that hated sign returns to you by right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, Hadji threw at the feet of Pog-Reis the carved
      silver casket that he had stolen from the ebony case belonging to Peyrou.
      This casket was wrapped in a scarf, designed to protect the broken cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog-Reis, little appreciative of the Bohemian&rsquo;s attention, made a sign to
      him to continue his route.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chebec took her place of headway behind the galley of Pog, and the
      three vessels soon disappeared in the east, directing their course with
      all possible speed toward the isles of St Honorât, where they intended to
      lie in for repairs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. DISCOVERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pog was too closely occupied with the disabled condition in which he found
      his galleys, to lend attention to the last words of Hadji. One of the
      spahis picked up the casket, and placed it in Pog&rsquo;s chamber, to which the
      latter had descended, after leaving the galley in the command of the
      pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chamber was entirely covered with a coarse red woollen material. On
      this tapestry could be seen, here and there, a great number of black
      crosses traced by the hand with charcoal. Among them a small number of
      white crosses appeared, drawn with chalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copper lamp threw a wan and sepulchral light in this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only furniture of the room consisted in a bed, covered with a
      tiger-skin, two chairs, and an oak table, hardly square.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Moor had dressed the wounds of the captain, he retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, left alone, remained seated, resting his head on his hand, and
      reflecting upon the events of the night His vengeance was only half
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      His precipitate retreat humiliated his self-love, and aroused new
      resentments in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he smiled as he thought of the evil he had wrought, and rose
      from his seat, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always so! My night will not have been lost, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took a piece of charcoal, and made several black crosses on the
      tapestry. From time to time he paused, as if to collect his thoughts. He
      had just traced a black cross when he said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Baron des Anbiez was killed! I think so, and I hope so. From the
      hollow vibration of the handle of the battle-axe in my hand, I thought I
      felt his skull broken. But the baron wore a helmet, his death is not
      certain. We will not make a false estimate of victims.&rdquo; After this
      lugubrious pleasantry, he erased the cross, and began to count the white
      crosses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;eleven chevaliers of Malta, slain by my hand. Oh! they
      are surely dead, for I would have killed myself a thousand times on their
      bodies, rather than have left in them one breath of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then sank into a gloomy silence. Suddenly, standing up, his arms
      crossed on his breast, his head bowed, he said, with a deep sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For more than twenty years I have pursued my vengeance,&mdash;my work of
      destruction. For twenty years has my sorrow diminished? Are my regrets
      less desperate? I do not know. Without doubt I feel a horrible joy in
      saying to man: &lsquo;Suffer&mdash;die.&rsquo; But after&mdash;after! Always regret&mdash;always!
      And yet I have no remorse, no! It seems to me that I am the blind
      instrument of an all-powerful will. Yes, that must be. It is not the love
      of gain which guides me. It is an imperious necessity, an insatiable need
      of vengeance. Where am I going? What will be the awakening from this
      bloody life which sometimes seems to me a horrible dream? When I think
      upon what was formerly my life, on what I was myself, it is something to
      drive me mad,&mdash;as I am. Yes, I must be mad, for sometimes there are
      moments when I ask myself: &lsquo;Why so many cruel deeds?&rsquo; To-night, for
      instance, how much blood&mdash;how much blood! That old man! Those women!
      Oh, I am mad, furiously mad! Oh, it is terrible! What had they done to
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hid his face in his hands. After a few moments of sullen reflection, he
      cried, in an agonising voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what had I done to him,&mdash;to the one who hurled me from heaven to
      hell? I never did him a wrong! What had I done to her,&mdash;to his
      accomplice? I surrounded her with all the adoration, all the idolatry that
      man could feel here below for a creature. And, yet! Oh!&mdash;this sorrow,&mdash;will
      it always be bleeding? Will this memory always be so dreadful,&mdash;always
      burning like a hot iron? Oh, rage! Oh, misery! Oh, to forget! to forget! I
      only ask to forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered these words, Pog fell with his face on the bed, tore the
      tiger-skin in his convulsed hands, and groaned with a sort of hollow,
      stifled roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paroxysm lasted some time, and was succeeded by a heavy stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he straightened himself up, his complexion paler than usual, his
      eyes brilliant, and his lips contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hand over his forehead to fasten the bandage around his
      wound, which had become disarranged. As he let his arm fall from weakness,
      he felt near the partition an object which he had not remarked. It was the
      casket which Hadji had thrown on board the <i>Red Galleon</i>, and that
      one of the men had left in the captain&rsquo;s chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog mechanically took up the casket and placed it on his knees. The
      Maltese cross embossed on the lid met his sight, and made him start.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw it abruptly away from him; the scarf became untied, and fell
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a large number of letters rolled on the floor, with two medallions,
      and a long tress of blond hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog was seated on his bed; the medallions had fallen a considerable
      distance from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light in his chamber was pale and fluctuating.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what miracle of love, of hatred, or of vengeance, did he recognise
      instantly the features that he had never forgotten?
    </p>
    <p>
      The event was so startling, so dreadful, that at first he believed himself
      to be the sport of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not dare move. His body leaning forward, his eyes fixed on the
      medallion, he feared every moment to see what he took for a vision of his
      excited imagination vanish from his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, falling on his knees, he threw himself upon the medallions, as if
      he feared they might escape his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized the portraits. One of them represented a woman of resplendent
      beauty. He was not mistaken; he had recognised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was the face of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirate let the medallion fall on the floor; he was petrified with
      amazement. He had just recognised Erebus! Erebus, at least, as he was
      fifteen years before, when he had carried him away from the coasts of
      Languedoc!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still doubting what he saw with his own eyes, he rallied from this passing
      weakness, picked up the medallion, recalled his memories with exactness,
      to provide against every error, and again examined the portrait with a
      consuming anxiety. It was Erebus, indeed,&mdash;Erebus at the age of five
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Pog threw himself on the floor with the letters, and read them on his
      knees without a thought of rising. The scene was something terrible,&mdash;ghastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, pale, stained with blood, kneeling in the middle of that
      lugubrious chamber, read with eagerness the pages which revealed to him,
      at last, the dark mystery which he had sought for so many years.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. THE LETTERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will now put before the eyes of the reader the letters that Pog was
      reading with such painful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first had been written by himself, about twenty years before the
      period of which we now speak. So striking was the contrast between his
      life then,&mdash;a life calm, happy, and smiling,&mdash;and the life of a
      pirate and murderer, that one might be moved to pity the unhappy man, if
      only by comparing him as he was, to what he had been in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The height from which he had fallen, the depth of infamy to which he had
      descended, must have moved the most obdurate heart to pity!
    </p>
    <p>
      These letters will unveil also what mysterious tie united the Commander
      des Anbiez, Erebus, and Pog, to whom we restore his real name, that of
      Count Jacques de Montreuil, former lieutenant of the king&rsquo;s galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Montreuil&mdash;Pog&mdash;had written the following letter to his
      wife on his return from a campaign of eight or nine months in the
      Mediterranean.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was dated from the lazaretto, or pest-house, in Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The galley of Count de Montreuil, having touched at Tripoli, of Syria,
      where the plague had been declared, was compelled according to custom to
      submit to a long quarantine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Emilie de Montreuil lived in a country house situated on the
      borders of the Rhone, near Lyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>First Letter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Lazaretto de Marseilles</i>, December 10,1612.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On board the <i>Capitaine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be true, Emilie,&mdash;can it be true? My heart overflows with
      joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know how to express my surprise to you. It is an intoxication of
      happiness, it is a flowering of the soul,&mdash;a foolish exaltation which
      borders on delirium, if each moment a holy, grateful thought did not lead
      me to God, the almighty author of our felicities!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you only knew, Emilie, how I have prayed to him, as I have blessed
      him! with what profound fervour I have lifted to him my transported soul!
      Thanks to thee, my God, who hast heard our prayers. Thanks to thee, my
      God, who dost crown the sacred love which unites us by giving us a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilie&mdash;Emilie, I am crazy with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I write this word,&mdash;a child,&mdash;my hand trembles, my heart
      leaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, for I am weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have wept with delight!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sweet tears! How good it is to weep!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilie, my wife, soul of my soul, life of my life, pure treasure of the
      purest virtues!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me now that your beautiful brow must radiate majesty. I
      prostrate myself before you, there is something so divine in maternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilie, you know it, since the three years of our union, our love, never
      has a cloud troubled it. Each day has added a day to this life of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, in spite of myself, doubtless, I have caused you, perhaps, not some
      pain, not some displeasure, but some little contrariety, and you always so
      sweet, so good, you have no doubt hidden it from me. Ah, well! in this
      solemn day I come to you on both knees, to ask your forgiveness as I would
      ask forgiveness of God for having offended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Emilie, that dear as you are to me, our ever reviving
      tenderness would change our solitude to paradise. Ah, well! this happiness
      of the past, which seemed then to go beyond all possible limits, is yet to
      be doubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not find, Emilie, that in the happiness of two there is a sort of
      egotism, a sort of isolation, which disappears when a cherished child
      comes to double our pleasures by adding to them the most tender, most
      touching, most adorable duties?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, these duties, how well you will understand them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not been a model of daughters? What sublime devotion to your
      father! What abnegation! What care!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! the best, the most adorable of daughters will be the best, the
      most adorable of mothers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! how we love each other, Emilie! And as we love each other, how we
      shall love it, this poor little being! My God! how we shall love it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife, my beloved angel, I weep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason is lost. Oh, forgive me, but I have had no news from you in so
      long a time, and then the first letter that you write me, after so many
      months of absence, comes to inform me of this. My God! how can I resist
      weeping?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know how to tell you of my dreams, my plans, the visions that I
      caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a daughter, she must be named Emilie, like you. I wish it. I ask
      it of you. There can be nothing more charming than these happy repetitions
      of names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see how I will gain by it? When I call an Emilie tenderly, two
      will come to me. That sweet name, the only name which now exists for me,
      will reach in two hearts at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a boy, would you wish to call it for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Emilie, we must not forget to put a little fence around the lake
      and on the border of the river. Great God! if our child should&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Emilie, as I know your heart, this fear will not appear
      exaggerated to you. It will not make you smile. No, no, but tears will
      fill your eyes. Oh, is not that true? is it not? I know you so well!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there an emotion of your heart to which I am a stranger? But tell me,
      how have I deserved so much love? What have I done so good, so great, that
      Heaven should recompense me thus?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I have always had religious sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that you have often said that, if I did not know exactly the
      feasts of the Church, I knew perfectly well the number of poor in the
      neighbourhood. Now, I feel the need, not of a more ardent faith, for I
      believe. Oh, I have so many reasons to believe,&mdash;to believe with
      fervour. But I feel the need of a life more soberly religious,&mdash;more
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe all to God; paternity is such an imposing priesthood. Now no action
      of our lives can be indifferent. Nothing belongs to us any longer. We must
      not only look forward to our own future, but to that of our child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, Emilie, that what you desire so much, that what you dared not
      ask me, out of respect for the will of my father; you think that my
      dismissal from the service is not a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not now an hour, a minute of my life, which does not belong to
      our child. If I have yielded to your entreaties with so much regret, poor
      wife, because I desired to follow the last request of my father
      faithfully, now it need be so no longer. Although our wealth is
      considerable, we must neglect nothing now which can increase it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heretofore we have trusted to agents the management of our affairs; now I
      shall undertake them myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be so much gained for our child. When the lease of our farms
      near Lyons has expired, we ourselves will put our lands in good condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, my love, the dream of my life has been to lead the life of a
      country gentleman in the midst of sweet and sacred family joys. Your
      tastes, your character, your angelic virtues, fit you also for the
      enjoyment of such peaceful pleasures and associations. What more can I
      say, my Emilie, my blessed angel of God?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been interrupted. The lazaretto boat is leaving this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in despair when I think of the long mortal month which still
      separates me from the spot where I shall fall on my knees, and we shall
      join our hands in thanking God for his gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This artless letter, puerile perhaps in its detail, but which pictured a
      happiness so profound, which spoke of hopes so radiant, was enclosed in
      another letter, bearing this address, &ldquo;To the Commander Pierre des
      Anbiez,&rdquo; and containing the following words, written in haste, and with a
      weak and trembling hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Second Letter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;December 13th, midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He believes me&mdash;read&mdash;read. I feel that I am about to die&mdash;read,
      that his letter may be our torment here below, while we wait for that
      which God reserves for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I am ashamed of you&mdash;of myself; we have been base&mdash;base
      like the traitors we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This infamous lie&mdash;never will I dare assert it before him&mdash;never
      will I allow him to believe that this child&mdash;Ah, I am in an abyss of
      despair!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be accursed! Depart, depart!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never has my sin appeared more terrible to me than since this execrable
      lie was made to impose upon his noble confidence in order to shield
      ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven protect this unfortunate child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under what horrible auspices will it be born, if it is born, for I feel
      now it must die before seeing the light&mdash;I can never survive the
      agony I suffer. Yet my husband is coming,&mdash;never will I lie to him.
      What shall I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, do not depart&mdash;my poor head wanders&mdash;at least&mdash;surely&mdash;you
      will not abandon me&mdash;no, no, do not depart&mdash;come&mdash;come&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pog, the Count de Montreuil, as the sequel will show, had never been able,
      in discovering his wife&rsquo;s guilt, to learn the name of the unhappy woman&rsquo;s
      seducer. Nor did he know that Erebus was the child of this adulterous
      connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he was overwhelmed with conflicting emotions. Although such a
      bitterness of resentment might seem puerile, after the lapse of so many
      years, his rage reached its height when he saw this letter, written by
      himself in the very intoxication of happiness, and full of those
      confidences of the soul which a man dares pour out only in the heart of a
      beloved wife, enclosed in one addressed to her seducer, when he realised
      that it had been read, perhaps laughed at, by his enemy, the Commander des
      Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his fury he could only think of the painful ridiculousness of his
      attitude in the eyes of that man, as he spoke with so much freedom, so
      much love, and so much idolatry, of a child which was not his, and of this
      wife who had so basely deceived him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deepest, the most agonising, the most incurable wounds are those which
      pain our heart and our self-love at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very excess of his wrath, his burning thirst for vengeance, brought
      Pog back, so to speak, to his religious sentiment. He saw the hand of God
      in the strange chance which had thrown Erebus, the fruit of this criminal
      love, in his pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrilled with a cruel joy at the thought that this unfortunate child,
      whose soul he had perverted, whom he had led in a way so fatal to all
      purity and happiness, would, perhaps, carry desolation and death into the
      Des Anbiez family.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw in this startling coincidence a terrible providential retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought was to go at once and assassinate Erebus, but, urged by
      a consuming curiosity, he desired to discover all the secrets of this
      guilty connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he continued to read the letters contained in the casket. The next
      letter, written by Madame de Montreuil, was also addressed to the
      Commander des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Third Letter</i>,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;December 14th, one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has had pity on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unfortunate child lives; if he continues to live, he will live only
      for you,&mdash;only for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My women are safe; this house is isolated, far from all help. To-morrow I
      shall send to the village for the venerable Abbé de Saint-Maurice,&mdash;another
      lie,&mdash;a sacrilegious lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him that this unfortunate child died in birth. Justine has
      already engaged a nurse; this nurse is waiting in the house occupied by
      the guard of the crossroads. This evening she will take the poor little
      being with her. This evening she will depart for Languedoc, as we have
      agreed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be separated from my child, who has cost me so many tears, so much
      sorrow, and such despair! To be separated from it for ever! Ah, I dare
      not, I cannot complain! It is the least expiation of my crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little creature, I have covered it with my tears, with my kisses; it
      is innocent of all this sin. Ah, dreadful, how dreadful it is! I shall not
      survive these heartrending emotions. That is all my hope. God will take me
      from this earth,&mdash;yes,&mdash;but to damn me in eternity!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I do not wish to die; no, I do not wish to die! Oh, pity, pity,
      mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just recovered from a long fainting-fit Peyrou will carry this
      letter to you; send him back without delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next letter announced to the commander that the sacrifice had been
      completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fourth Letter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;December 15th, ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is over. This morning the Abbé de Saint-Maurice came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My women told him that the child was dead, and that I, in my despair, had
      wished, in pious resignation, to shroud it myself in its coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that this poor priest is very old; and, besides, he has known me
      from my birth, and has a blind confidence in me, and not for a moment did
      he suspect this impious lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He prayed over an empty coffin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrilege, sacrilege!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God will be without pity! At last the coffin was carried and buried
      in our family chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, in the night, for the last time I embraced this unfortunate
      child, now abandoned, now without a name. Now the shame and remorse of
      those who have given it birth will ever&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not give him up&mdash;I could not. Alas! it was always a kiss,&mdash;just
      a last kiss. When Justine snatched it from my arms it uttered a pitiful
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that feeble wail of sorrow reëchoes in the depths of my soul; what a
      fatal omen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I ask, what will become of it? Oh, what will become of it? That
      woman&mdash;that nurse, who is she? What interest will she take in this
      unfortunate orphan? She will be indifferent to its tears, to its sorrows;
      miserable woman, its poor weeping will never move her as I have been
      stirred by its one feeble wail!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this woman? Who is this woman, I ask. Justine says she will answer
      for her, but has Justine the heart of a mother, which could answer for
      her, could judge her? I, yes, I would have known so quickly if she was
      worthy of confidence. Why did I not think of that? Why did I not see her
      myself? Ah, God is just! the guilty wife could be nothing but a bad
      mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little one! He is going to suffer. Who will protect him? Who will
      defend him? If this woman is unfaithful,&mdash;if she is avaricious, she
      is going to let him want for everything,&mdash;he is going to be cold,&mdash;he
      is going to be hungry,&mdash;perhaps she will beat him! Oh, my child, my
      child!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am an unnatural mother,&mdash;I am base,&mdash;I am infamous,&mdash;I
      am afraid,&mdash;I have not the courage of my crime. No, no, I will not! I
      will not! I will brave all, the return of my husband, the shame, ay, death
      itself, but I will not be separated for ever from my child; nothing but
      death shall separate us,&mdash;there is time enough yet Justine is coming.
      I am going to tell her to go for the nurse and instruct her to remain
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing!&mdash;oh, my God! to be at the mercy of these people
      like that! Justine refuses to tell me the route this woman has taken,&mdash;she
      has dared to speak to me of my duties, of what I owe to my husband. Oh,
      shame, shame! once I was so proud, to be reduced to this! Yet she weeps
      while she denies me; poor woman, she thinks I am insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is so awful is, that I dare not invoke Heaven&rsquo;s blessing on this
      unfortunate child, abandoned at its birth; it is devoted to grief. What
      will become of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you at least will not abandon it, but in his infancy, at that age
      when he will have so much need of care and tenderness, what can you do for
      him? Nothing, oh, my God, nothing! And besides, may you not die in battle?
      Oh, how dreadful would that be&mdash;fortunately I am so weak, that I
      shall not survive this agony, or rather I shall die under the first look
      of him whom I have so terribly offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each one of his letters, so faithful, so noble, so tender, strikes me a
      mortal blow. Yesterday I announced to him the fatal news, another lie. How
      he will suffer! Already he loved the child so much!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how dreadful, how dreadful! but this struggle will soon end, yes, I
      feel it, the end is very near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre, I wish nevertheless to see you before I die. It is more than a
      presentiment&mdash;it is a certainty. I tell you that never shall I see
      him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it, if I see him again, I feel it, his presence will kill
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow you must leave France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When this poor child is confided to you, if he survives his sad infancy,
      Pierre, love him, oh, love him! He will never have had a mother&rsquo;s love. I
      wish, if he is worthy of the sacred vocation, and if it suits his mind and
      his character, I wish him to be a priest. Some day you will tell him the
      terrible secret of his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will pray for you and for me, and perhaps Heaven will hear his
      prayers. I feel very feeble, very feeble. Again, Pierre, I must see you.
      Ah, how cruelly we expiate a few days of madness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, that which most pains me is his confidence. Oh, I tell you
      that the sight of him will kill me. I feel that I must die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marks of the tears could still be seen upon this letter written with a
      feeble, fainting hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, after having read the pages which portrayed so faithfully the agony
      of Emilie&rsquo;s soul, gazed thoughtfully upon the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head on his breast. That man so cruelly outraged, that man
      hardened by hatred, could not refuse a feeling of pity for this unhappy
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear, a burning tear, the only one he had shed in years, coursed his
      weather-beaten cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his resentment against the author of all these woes rose again in
      fury. He thanked Heaven for having at last made known to him the seducer
      of Emilie, but he did not now wish to concentrate his thought on the
      terrible vengeance that he meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next letter was in the handwriting of Emilie. She informed the
      commander of the consequence of the last venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fifth Letter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;December 16th, nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband knows the supposed death of the child; his despair borders on
      madness. His letter terrifies me with its wild and passionate grief. The
      quarantine ends in fifteen days. I shall not live until that time; my
      crime will be buried with me, and he will regret me, and he will weep my
      memory, perhaps. Oh, to deceive, to deceive, to deceive even to the coffin
      and the grave! God! will he ever forgive me? It is an abyss of terror into
      which I dare not cast my eyes. This evening, at eleven o&rsquo;clock, Justine
      will open the little gate at the park. Pierre, these are solemn farewells,
      funereal, perhaps. To-morrow, then, to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE MURDERER
    </h2>
    <p>
      A paper, part of which was torn, contained this written confession, in the
      handwriting of the commander, a few days after the bloody tragedy which he
      relates. The person to whom it was addressed is unknown. Some passages,
      tom intentionally, perhaps, seem to refer to a journey, made by the
      commander in Languedoc at the same period, for the purpose, no doubt, of
      learning the fate of his unfortunate child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my hands are stained with blood. I have just committed a murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have assassinated the man against whom I have committed a deadly wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock I presented myself at the little gate of the park. I
      was conducted into the chamber of Emilie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was in bed, pale, almost dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She, formerly so beautiful, seemed the ghost of herself. The hand of God
      had already touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seated myself at her bedside. She extended to me her trembling, icy
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pressed it to my lips, my cold lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We gave a last painful look at the past I accused myself of having
      destroyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We spoke of our unfortunate child. We wept, oh, how bitterly! when
      suddenly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I feel still the cold sweat deluge my brow. My hair stands on end,
      and a terrible voice cries to me, &lsquo;Murderer! Murderer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will not seek to fly from remorse; till my last day I shall keep
      before me the image of my victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the judgment of God, which has already condemned me, I take oath to do
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me recall the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a terrible moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chamber of Emilie was dimly lighted by a night-lamp placed near the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My back was toward this door. I was seated by her bed. She could not
      retain her sobs. My forehead was resting on my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most profound silence reigned around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had just spoken to her of our child. I had just promised to fulfil her
      will in reference to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had tried to console her, to induce her to hope for better days, to
      reanimate her courage, to give her strength to conceal all from her
      husband; to prove to her that, for his own peace and happiness, it was
      better to let him remain in confident security.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly the door behind me opened with violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilie cried in terror: &lsquo;My husband! I am dead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I could turn around, an involuntary movement of her husband
      extinguished the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were all three in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do not kill me before forgiving me!&rsquo; cried Emilie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh&mdash;you first&mdash;him afterwards,&rsquo; said Count de Montreuil, in a
      hollow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment was horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He advanced irresolutely. I advanced also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to meet him and hold him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We said nothing. The silence was profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing was heard but the sound of our oppressed breathing, and the low,
      spasmodic voice of Emilie, who murmured: &lsquo;Lord have pity on me! Lord have
      pity on me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly I felt a hand as cold as marble on my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the hand of her husband. In seeking her, he had touched me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He started, and said, without concerning himself further about me: &lsquo;Her
      bed ought to be on the left!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His calmness terrified me. I threw myself on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that moment, Emilie, whom he had doubtless already seized, cried,
      &lsquo;Mercy! Mercy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to take him by the middle of his body. I felt the point of a
      dagger graze my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilie uttered a long sigh. She was killed or wounded, her blood spouted
      up on my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my brain became wild; I felt myself endowed with a supernatural
      strength. With my left hand I seized the right arm of the murderer; with
      my right hand I snatched his dagger from him, and plunged it twice in his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him fall without uttering a cry. From that moment I remember
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found myself at the rising of the sun lying by the side of a hedge. I
      was covered with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some moments I could remember nothing, then all returned to my
      memory. I returned home, avoiding the sight of every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I discovered, as I entered, that my Maltese cross was lost. Perhaps it
      had been taken away from me in the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found Peyrou, who was waiting for me with my horses. I arrived here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Some pages are wanting in this place.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... and she is no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lies by her side in the same tomb. The idea of murder pursues me. I am
      doubly criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My entire life will not suffice to expiate this murder, and...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of this page was wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last letter which the casket contained was a letter addressed to
      Peyrou by a bargemaster in the neighbourhood of Aiguemortes five years
      after the events which we have just recorded, and the same year, no doubt,
      of the abduction of Erebus by the pirates on the coast of Languedoc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peyrou, who was then serving on board the galleys of religion with the
      commander, was in the secret of this strange and bloody tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter was addressed to Malta, to which place he had
      followed the commander, who, five years after these fatal events had
      transpired, was still unwilling to enter France.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To M. Bernard Peyrou, Overseer-Patron of Our Lady of Seven Sorrows</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Peyrou:&mdash;Three days ago a great calamity occurred. A pirate
      galley made a descent on the unguarded coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pirates put all to fire and sword, and carried off into slavery all
      the inhabitants upon whom they could fasten their chains. I hardly know
      how to tell you the rest of this misfortune. The woman Agniel and the
      child that you confided to her care have disappeared, no doubt massacred,
      or carried away captives by these pirates. I went into her house, and
      everything there showed marks of violence. Alas! I must tell you, there
      remained no doubt that the woman and child had shared the fate of the
      other inhabitants of this unfortunate village. We can hardly hope that the
      child was able to endure the fatigues and hardships of the voyage. I send
      you the only thing that could be found in the house, the picture of the
      child, which, in obedience to your order, the woman Agniel had taken to
      Montpellier, where the portrait had been executed about a month before. I
      saw the child quite recently, and I can assure you that it is an excellent
      likeness. Alas! it is, perhaps, all that remains of him now. I send this
      letter directly to Malta by the tartan <i>St. Cecile</i>, so that it may
      reach you safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S. In case the child is recovered, I inform you that there is a
      Maltese cross tattooed on his arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To complete the explanation of the tragedy, it remains to be said that,
      although Pog&mdash;the Count de Montreuil&mdash;was dangerously wounded,
      he retained sufficient strength and presence of mind to keep the events of
      that fatal night a profound secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of Emilie, he commanded Justine, under the direst threats,
      to say that her mistress, overwhelmed with grief at the death of her
      child, had finally succumbed to the desperate illness which ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing seemed more plausible than this account, hence it was generally
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count de Montreuil remained concealed in his house until his wound was
      thoroughly healed. With every conceivable threat and promise, he tried to
      induce Justine to reveal the secret of the child&rsquo;s hiding-place, but all
      his efforts were unavailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now becomes necessary to explain how the count surprised the interview
      between Emilie and the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning the supposed death of his child, while in the lazaretto or
      pest-house near Marseilles, he was plunged in desperate grief. He believed
      that his wife was no less inconsolable, and, notwithstanding the penalty
      of death incurred by deserters from the lazaretto, before the expiration
      of the established quarantine, he swam that night even from the island
      Ratonneau, where the sanitary buildings were situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the coast, where a trusty servant awaited him with clothing, he
      assumed another name, and galloped in hot haste on the road to Lyons.
      Leaving his horses about two leagues from his house, he accomplished the
      rest of the journey on foot. Passing through the little gate which the
      commander had left open, he entered the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days before, by way of precaution, Emilie had dismissed most of
      her servants, under various pretexts, retaining two women only of whom she
      felt sure. Her husband, finding the house almost deserted, entered
      unperceived, and stood at the door of Emilie&rsquo;s chamber, while she believed
      that he would remain ten days longer in the lazaretto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the conversation which took place between his wife and Pierre des
      Anbiez, the Count de Montreuil could have no further doubt of her
      infidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had entirely recovered from his wounds, he abandoned his house,
      situated in the country near Lyons, for ever; and feeling sure of
      Justine&rsquo;s silence, as the woman had no interest in betraying his secret,
      he left France, taking with him a considerable sum in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his disappearance from the lazaretto was discovered, it was believed
      and currently reported that the Count de Montreuil, frenzied by grief over
      the loss of his child, had thrown himself into the sea. While this rumour
      was accepted in France, the commander believed that his victim had died
      from his wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that the Count de Montreuil was ignorant of the name of
      Emilie&rsquo;s seducer, and the only clew he had was the commander&rsquo;s Maltese
      cross, which had fallen on the floor of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cross bore the initials L. P. on its ring, which letters proved that
      its owner belonged to the Provençal nation. This explains the intense
      hatred which Pog cherished against the chevaliers of Malta.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thirst for vengeance was so blind, that, by preference, he directed
      his attacks against Languedoc and Provence, because Emilie&rsquo;s seducer must
      have been a chevalier of Malta, born in that province.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say, if the love Pog felt for Emilie before her betrayal
      was strong and passionate, the rage, or rather the monomania, which seized
      his mind after he learned of the deception practised upon him, was in
      itself a terrible proof of his love and desperate grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait which hung above the coffin which served as a bed for the
      Commander des Anbiez, as a part of the expiation of his crime, was the
      portrait of the Count de Montreuil, or Pog,&mdash;obtained by Peyrou at
      the sale of the house near Lyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now return to Pog, in his chamber on the <i>Red Galleon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having read the letters which unveiled so many mysteries, he
      remained for a time in a sort of dazed state of mind. He closed his eyes.
      A thousand conflicting thoughts and ideas reached his brain. He feared he
      was losing his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees he recovered his self-possession, and contemplated the new
      opportunities which this discovery offered his hatred with a calmness
      which was more dreadful than anger.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. PLANS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once enlightened on the subject of the birth of Erebus, Pog, in his
      diabolical joy, thanked the devil for having delivered the child into his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the feelings of aversion which Erebus had inspired in him were now
      explained; all his impulses of tenderness for the unfortunate youth could
      now be easily understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus was the son of his mortal enemy; but he was also the son of the
      woman whom he had adored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the secret instinct of hatred and of vengeance which dominated his
      being unconsciously, he could never have taken such pleasure in corrupting
      and perverting a young and innocent soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most hardened hearts find a solace in the thought that their crimes
      are justifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment, Pog saw into his hatred clearly, if it may be said; his
      only indecision now was how to satiate his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the necessity for prudence, that his vengeance might be sure and
      complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Erebus could not satisfy him; that death, however slow,
      however cruel it might be, would be only one day of torment,&mdash;that no
      longer sufficed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violence of his rage could not dissociate the innocent result of the
      crime from the crime itself, or from those who committed it, but Pog had
      long ceased to think or act with regard to justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his opinion, Erebus was justly devoted to his wrath. He felt, too, a
      sinister joy in learning that Pierre des Anbiez was the seducer of his
      wife. Now he knew where to direct his blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything seemed to favour his plans. He believed he had killed Raimond
      V., Baron des Anbiez, in the attack on La Ciotat. Reine, abducted by
      Erebus, was the niece of the commander. Thus destiny assisted him in his
      hatred and pursuit of this family. Such were the bitter and triumphant
      feelings which filled his heart when the two galleys and the chebec
      reached their place of anchorage off the isles of Ste. Marguerite.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had scarcely anchored when Hadji came on board the <i>Red Galleon</i>,
      and found Pog absorbed in his reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words he informed him of the designs of Erebus, and of his vain
      attempts to seduce the crew of the chebec and fly to the Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog turned pale with fright. Erebus might have escaped him but for the
      fidelity of Hadji and his sailors! His vengeance baffled!
    </p>
    <p>
      He manifested toward the Bohemian such overwhelming gratitude for his
      behaviour under the circumstances, that the latter stood gazing at him in
      bewilderment, so strangely did these grateful expressions contrast with
      the usual habit and bearing of Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reassure yourself, Captain Pog,&rdquo; said Hadji, &ldquo;you need not carry on your
      conscience such a weight of gratitude; the sailors and I remained faithful
      to you because our interest demands it That obligation is superior to all
      others; but if you will believe me, Captain Pog, you will seize the first
      opportunity to put that young man ashore. He is getting spoiled,&mdash;he
      is getting weak; a little while ago he was weeping at the feet of those
      two women. So I advise you to abandon him at the first opportunity. He can
      only be in our way now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abandon Erebus!&rdquo; cried Pog, with such passionate energy that Hadji looked
      at him in amazement &ldquo;Abandon Erebus! but you do not know&mdash;what am I
      saying,&mdash;how can you know? This instant,&mdash;this instant bring the
      boy to me. You answer to me for him with your life&mdash;with your life,
      do you understand? Or indeed&mdash;but no&mdash;I will go myself on board
      his chebec; that will be more sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the pilot of the Red Galleon entered with an excited
      air. &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said he, to Pog, &ldquo;in examining the horizon with my
      telescope, I have just discovered a galley and a polacre. These two
      vessels may pass without discovering us. Eblis grant it, for the black
      galley is fatal to those she attacks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black galley?&rdquo; asked Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does not know the black galley of the Commander des Anbiez?&rdquo; said the
      pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, no doubt!&rdquo; cried the Bohemian. &ldquo;They expected the commander every day
      at Maison-Forte, the castle of Raimond V. Pierre des Anbiez must have
      arrived after us, he must have seen the citizens&rsquo; houses in flames, and
      known that his niece was carried off and his brother killed, and he is
      seeking us to avenge them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That galley is the galley of the commander Pierre des Anbiez?&rdquo; said Pog,
      stuttering, so profound was his astonishment &ldquo;Pierre des Anbiez&mdash;the
      commander&mdash;here&mdash;he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to picture the burst of savage joy with which Pog uttered
      these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short silence, during which he passed his hand over his brow, as
      if to assure himself that what happened around him was real, he suddenly
      fell on his knees, clasped his hands, and said, with an air of the deepest
      piety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, my God! Forgive me. Long have I doubted thy justice; to-day it
      reveals itself to me in all its glorious majesty! Lord&mdash;Lord&mdash;forgive
      me. Grief has distracted me; now thine almighty power is manifest in my
      sight. The same day thou dost place father and son at the mercy of my
      vengeance, after twenty years of torture. My God! after twenty years. Lord&mdash;Lord,
      upon my knees I thank thee; my entire life will not suffice to pray to
      thee, and to bless thee! The father and son in my power! My God, thou art
      sovereignly great! Thou art sovereignly just!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The violent transports of fury to which Pog was subject had never
      terrified Hadji, but this prayer, delivered in a low, trembling, solemn
      voice, filled him with a vague disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      This miserable creature, who hesitated before no evil, now trembled with
      fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, something formidable was required thus to bow Pog in the dust,
      and wrest from him this cry of gratitude and submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having uttered this prayer, Pog rose and walked a long time in great
      agitation without saying a word. He forgot the presence of Hadji and the
      pilot A half-hour passed thus, the Bohemian staring at Pog all the while
      with an eager, sinister curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was waiting to see what strange and fatal result would follow this
      chaos of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, as was ordinarily the case when he yielded to such violence of
      emotion, felt quite weak; he became as pale as a ghost, he sank down, and,
      but for the timely aid of Hadji and the pilot, would have fallen
      backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian bore him to his bed, drew a smelling-bottle from his girdle,
      held it to his nostrils, and soon Pog-Reis recovered from his swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember all now,&rdquo; said he, looking around him anxiously. &ldquo;I remember
      all. You see I am weak,&mdash;but, Hadji, what do you wish? the time of
      miracles has returned. Oh, this mark of the almighty power of the Most
      High imposes obligations on me; now I am strong; now I will not compromise
      the ends of Heaven&rsquo;s justice by anticipating it No, no, I await its voice.
      It shall be obeyed, and a terrible example shall be given to the world.
      You must send Erebus to me, Hadji.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, and the calmness of Pog&rsquo;s countenance and accent, were
      additional cause for the astonishment of Hadji.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done as you wish, captain. I am going to send the young man
      to you, or, for greater surety, conduct him to you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not all, Hadji. You love pillage as much as Trimalcyon-Reis, but
      you also love combat for the sake of combat, and danger for danger&rsquo;s
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I did not have my part either in the pillage or the danger last
      night, captain! I held the hook, but the fish was not for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Hadji, you can have presently your part in a brilliant combat, or
      remain spectator. You must go out with the chebec to join the black galley
      of the Commander des Anbiez. The speed of your vessel is superior to that
      of all the galleys. You will hoist the black flag and allure the commander
      into this road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand me, Hadji! The culverin of Mai-son-Forte has done such
      damage to our water-line and other parts of the ship that it will be
      several days before she is repaired sufficiently to put to sea, but we
      could in a few hours put her in a state to sustain a battle at anchor, and
      few such battles have been as you will see, Hadji, if you lead the black
      galley into this bay! If you wish to preserve the chebec which belongs to
      me, do not enter the bay, Hadji, for as soon as the black galley once sees
      the <i>Red Galleon</i>, she will hardly think of pursuing you. Then you
      can set sail to the south. I give you the chebec and slaves, Hadji.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for the sake of possessing the chebec that I will do as you
      wish me to do,&rdquo; replied Hadji, with sullen pride. &ldquo;Who could have
      prevented my profiting from the offers of Erebus? Who now could prevent my
      saying I consent to what you wish, and then setting sail to the south,
      instead of going out to sea after the black galley? I will lead the
      commander&rsquo;s ship here to you, and I will take part in the battle, because
      it pleases me, because, notwithstanding your calm appearance, a terrible
      tempest has gathered in your soul, which I wish to see burst forth. I am
      of an inquisitive turn of mind, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, by the wrath of Heaven, whose instrument I am, you will see a
      beautiful storm let loose, if you return!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall return, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all, say nothing to Trimalcyon of my plan; that fat brute, once
      under fire, will do his duty in spite of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make yourself easy, captain, before an hour the black galley will be in
      pursuit of me around this point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;and then,&rdquo; said Pog, talking to himself with a solemn,
      inspired air,&mdash;&ldquo;then this bay, now so peaceful, will behold one of
      the greatest tragedies,&mdash;a tragedy whose very memory will terrify
      humanity for generations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, and I shall return with Erebus, captain,&rdquo; said Hadji.
    </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog knelt down and prayed.

      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE INTERVIEW
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the Bohemian was on board the Red Galleon Erebus, now virtually
      considered a prisoner, shared the cabin of the chebec with Reine and
      Stephanette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her anger, notwithstanding her fright, notwithstanding her
      keen anxiety concerning the fate of her father, Mlle. des Anbiez could not
      remain insensible to the despair of Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reproached himself so bitterly for her abduction, and had done so much
      to obtain from the Bohemian both her liberty and that of Stephanette, that
      she could not stifle every emotion of pity that rose in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, in the frightful position in which she was placed, she felt that
      in him, at least, she had a defender.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeble ray of the sun lighted the little apartment where these three
      persons were associated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette, exhausted by fatigue, was sleeping, half-recumbent on a mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine, seated, hid her face in her two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus stood with his arms crossed and head bowed, while great tears
      rolled down his pale cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing, I see no help,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice; then,
      lifting a supplicating glance to Reine, he said: &ldquo;What can be done, my
      God, to snatch you from the hands of these wretches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, my father!&rdquo; said Reine, in a hollow voice. Then turning to
      Erebus, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah, be accursed, you have caused all my sorrows!
      But for you I should be with my father. Perhaps he is suffering&mdash;perhaps
      he is wounded! And then at least he would have my care. Ah, be accursed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, always accursed!&rdquo; repeated Erebus, with bitterness. &ldquo;My mother
      doubtless cursed me at my birth! Cursed by the man who reared me! Cursed
      by you!&rdquo; added he, in a heartrending voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not taken a daughter from her father? Have you not often been
      the accomplice of the brigands who ravaged that unfortunate city!&rdquo; cried
      Reine, with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake do not crush me! Yes, I have been their accomplice.
      But, my God! have compassion on me. I was brought up to evil, as you have
      been brought up to good. You had a mother. You have a father. You have had
      always before your eyes noble examples to imitate. I,&mdash;thrown by
      chance among these wretches at the age of four or five years, I believe,
      without parents, without relations, a victim of Pog-Reis, who for his
      pastime&mdash;he told me yesterday&mdash;trained me to evil as one would
      train a young wolf to slaughter, accustomed to hear nothing but the
      language of bad passions, to know no restraint,&mdash;yet, at least, I
      repent of the evils I have caused. I weep&mdash;I weep with despair,
      because I cannot save you. These tears, which the most cruel suffering
      would not have wrung from me,&mdash;these tears are the expression of the
      remorse I feel for having wronged you. This wrong I have tried to repair
      by wishing to conduct you back to your father. Unfortunately, I could not
      succeed. Ah, if I only had not met you that day in the rocks of Provence,
      if only I had not seen your beauty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word more,&rdquo; said Reine, with dignity. &ldquo;It was that day my sorrows
      began. Oh, it was indeed a fatal day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fatal, for if I had not seen you I should never have felt an
      aspiration toward good. My life would always have been a life of crime. I
      should never have been tormented by the remorse which now consumes me,&rdquo;
       said Erebus, with a gloomy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy man!&rdquo; cried Reine, carried away in spite of herself by her secret
      preference. &ldquo;Do not speak thus. Notwithstanding all the evil you have done
      me and mine, I shall despise our fatal meeting less, if you owe to it the
      only feelings which some day may result in the saving of your soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine des Anbiez uttered these words with such earnestness, and with such
      an accent of interest, that Erebus clasped his hands, looking at her with
      gratitude and astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save my soul! I do not understand your words. Pog-Reis has always taught
      me there was no soul, but at last I see that you have a little pity for
      me. Those are the only kind words I have ever heard during my existence.
      Severity and cruelty repel me. Goodness would surely conquer me, would
      render me better, but, alas! who cares whether I am better or not? No one!
      I see only hatred, contempt, or indifference around me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand over his eyes, and remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine could not repress an emotion of pity for the unfortunate youth, nor
      a feeling of horror at the thought of his cruel education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved with compassion, she could but hope that his natural instincts
      toward good had prevented his utter corruption. Since she had been in the
      power of the pirates, the conduct of Erebus had never transgressed the
      limits of the most profound respect. If he had abducted her from her
      father&rsquo;s castle, with a most criminal audacity, he had, at least, shown in
      his bearing toward her a delicacy and forbearance which seemed almost like
      timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This decided contrast proved to her the struggle of a noble, generous
      nature against a perverse education, and her imagination fondly pictured
      what he might have been, but for the cruel fate which imposed such a life
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these sentiments soon gave way to the anxious fears which agitated her
      mind concerning her father, and she cried with tears, &ldquo;Oh, my father, my
      father! when shall I see him again? Oh, how dreadful!&rdquo; Erebus, thinking
      that she addressed him, replied, sadly, &ldquo;Do you think I would not attempt
      everything in the world to take you from this vessel? But what can be
      done? Ah, without you, without the vague hope that I have been useful to
      you&mdash;&rdquo; Erebus could not finish, but his countenance was so sad that
      Reine, frightened, cried, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that when one cannot endure life the best thing is to get rid of
      it; when you are rescued and in safety, Erebus will give a last thought to
      you, and then kill himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another crime! he will end a life already so guilty by another misdeed!&rdquo;
       cried Reine. &ldquo;But you do not know that your life belongs to God only!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus smiled bitterly, and replied: &ldquo;My life belongs to me, since I can
      free myself from it when it becomes a burden. When I shall have left you,
      I can live no longer. I do not kill myself at your feet, because I still
      hope to be useful to you. What good is my life henceforth? You have made
      me understand how criminal has been the life I have been leading. But the
      future! The future for me is you, and I am unworthy of you, and you do not
      love me&mdash;and you will never love me. Ah, cursed be the Bohemian who
      has deceived me, who told me that you had not forgotten him who saved your
      father&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never forgotten that you were my father&rsquo;s saviour,&rdquo; said Reine,
      with dignity, &ldquo;nor can I forget the outrage practised upon me, yet I ought
      to take kindly what you have done to repair that wrong. Repentance for the
      greatest crimes finds pardon before the Lord! If I am permitted to see my
      father and my home again, I will forgive you. But before I leave, I will
      say to you: &lsquo;Never despair of the infinite goodness of God! Instead of
      yielding to an insane despair, abandon for ever those who made you their
      accomplice, seek instruction in our holy religion, learn to know and love
      and bless the Lord, become a good man; prove by an exemplary life that you
      have forsaken the criminal career which wicked men forced upon you; then
      can we pity your past misfortunes, then we can forget your outrages, then
      we can believe, indeed, that you wish to expiate the guilty actions of the
      past, by good.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I follow your counsel,&rdquo; cried Erebus, transported by the pious and
      lofty language of Reine, &ldquo;if I become a good man, may I some day present
      myself at Maison-Forte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine looked downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the cabin suddenly opened, and the Bohemian entered, and
      perhaps saved the young girl from an embarrassing reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette started out of sleep, and said, artlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my God, mademoiselle, I dreamed that I was married to my poor Luquin,
      who had rescued us, and that he was having that wicked vagabond hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I wish, my pretty girl,&rdquo; said the Bohemian, with an insolent smile,
      &ldquo;is that the very opposite of your dream may happen, which is usually the
      case. You can believe that such are my intentions concerning Captain
      Luquin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Erebus, impatiently, interrupting Hadji.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come for you. Pog-Reis wants you. He is waiting for you on board
      the <i>Red Galleon</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Pog-Reis that I will not leave this chebec except to conduct Mlle,
      des Anbiez ashore. She has no other protector, and I will not abandon
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian, knowing the determined spirit of Erebus, preferred to have
      recourse to a lie to employing force to take him away from the young
      girls, and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis asks for you because he wishes to get rid of you. He knows that
      you tried to make his crew act contrary to his orders. As to these two
      women, he prefers a ransom. You are to go and demand this ransom from
      Raimond V. As soon as the money is here, you can conduct the two doves to
      Maison-Forte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a decoy to separate me from them,&rdquo; cried Erebus. &ldquo;You are lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I only wished to take you away, my young captain, what would
      hinder my calling our men to my aid, and making them carry you off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a kangiar in my belt,&rdquo; said Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you have stabbed one, or two, or three of these honest pirates,
      will you not be obliged to yield to numbers sooner or later? So believe
      me; go on board the <i>Red Galleon</i>. Pog-Reis will give you his orders
      and a little boat. You will go to Raimond V., and to-morrow you can be
      here with a large sum of gold that the old baron will be only too glad to
      give for his daughter. To-morrow, I tell you, you can take away these two
      girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, what is to be done?&rdquo; cried Reine. &ldquo;That man perhaps is speaking
      the truth. And my father would not hesitate to give any sum, whatever it
      might be. Yet, if the man is lying, we will only lose our only protector,&rdquo;
       added she, turning to Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus was equally perplexed. He realised that he must succumb to numbers
      at last, and that, in refusing Pog-Reis, he would only aggravate the
      situation of Mlle, des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some moments of reflection Reine said to Erebus, in a voice full of
      courage:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to my father, and give me that weapon,&rdquo; and she pointed to the dagger
      which Erebus wore at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am left without a defender, but at least death will be able to save
      from dishonour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impressed with these simple and dignified words, Erebus knelt respectfully
      before Reine, and gave her his kangiar without uttering a word, as if he
      feared to profane the solemnity of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the cabin, followed by the Bohemian, embarked in a small boat, and
      presented himself to Pog, on board the <i>Red Galleon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji left Erebus on board this vessel, and returned to the chebec to
      carry out the orders of Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian set sail and was out of the bay before Reine and Stephanette
      knew that he had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few tacks, he distinguished perfectly the commander&rsquo;s black galley
      and Captain Trinquetaille&rsquo;s polacre to his windward. The two vessels were
      coming from La Ciotat. A few words will explain their presence in sight of
      the bay, and how they had been able to follow the track of the pirates.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE THREE BROTHERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez arrived at Cape l&rsquo;Aigle at the break of day. Scarcely
      had the black galley anchored in the port of La Ciotat, when the commander
      and his brother descended to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere they saw marks of the pirate&rsquo;s barbarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weeping inhabitants then knew all the extent of their losses. Each
      family had learned which one of its members had perished or had been taken
      captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the battle, they thought only of defending themselves and repulsing
      the enemy; then, too, night had veiled the disasters which day revealed in
      all their horror. On one side, walls blackened by the conflagration barely
      supported the tottering carpentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther on was the town hall, of which only the walls remained. Its
      windows were broken, its balcony demolished, its doors burned to ashes,
      its foundations charred, and showers of balls everywhere proved that the
      citizens had defended themselves with vigorous earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large square of La Ciotat, the theatre of the most murderous conflict
      of that fatal night, was covered with dead bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more heartrending than to see the afflicted inhabitants
      seeking a father, a brother, a son, or a friend among these dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they recognised one whom they sought, the others, petrified with
      grief, would look on in silence; again, some would utter impotent cries
      for vengeance; and some in their wild lamentation would rush to the port,
      as if they would there find the galleys of the lawless brigands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander and Father Elzear walked through this scene of desolation,
      speaking words of consolation to the unfortunate sufferers, and asking
      information of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      They learned that he had made a most valuable and courageous defence, by
      attacking the pirates at the head of the company from Maison-Forte, but no
      one could tell them if the baron was wounded or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers, in their anxiety, hastened to Maison-Forte, followed by
      a few subordinate officers of the galley, and by Luquin Trinquetaille, who
      had also anchored his polacre in the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at the Castle des Anbiez. The bridge was lowered, and the
      great court deserted, although it was the hour for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      They mounted the stairs in haste, and reached the immense hall in which
      the pious Christmas ceremonies had taken place the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the inmates of Maison-Forte, men, women, old people, and children,
      were kneeling in this vast hall, where reigned the most profound silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So absorbed was this crowd in its devotions, and so anxiously did they
      watch the half-open door of the baron&rsquo;s chamber, that not one perceived
      the entrance of the commander and Father Elzear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the hall, under the dais, was the cradle, the masterpiece
      of Dame Dulceline and the good chaplain. A few candles still burned in the
      copper chandeliers. The colossal Christmas log was smoking in the depth of
      the vast chimney, still ornamented with green branches and fruits and
      flowers and ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing seemed more startling than this scene lighted by the first pale
      rays of a winter day; nothing more painful than the contrast between the
      feast of the night and the sorrow of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having contemplated this quiet and imposing scene, the commander
      gently called aside some of the baron&rsquo;s vassals to open a way to the door
      of the baron&rsquo;s chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, the commander, and good Father Elzear!&rdquo; were the words which
      circulated among the anxious crowd, as they waited for news of the baron&rsquo;s
      condition, whether or not his wounds permitted them to indulge a hope for
      his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez and his brother, with a soft and cautious tread, entered
      the chamber of Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, still dressed in his holiday attire, even to his long
      boots, was lying on his bed. His venerable face was livid, and his flowing
      white locks were stained with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbé Mascarolus was dressing the wounds in his head, assisted in this
      pious duty by Honorât de Berrol. Dame Dulceline, whose tears never ceased
      to flow, was cutting cloth bands, while the majordomo Laramée, standing at
      the foot of the bed, apparently unconscious of all around him, was sobbing
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      So absorbed were the actors in this sad scene, that Father Elzear and
      Pierre des Anbiez entered unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; cried the commander and the priest at the same time, falling
      on their knees at the bedside of the baron, and kissing his cold hands
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the wounds serious, abbé?&rdquo; said the commander, while Father Elzear
      remained on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! is it you, M. Commander?&rdquo; said the chaplain, clasping his hands in
      surprise; &ldquo;if only you had arrived yesterday all these misfortunes would
      not have happened, and monseigneur would not be in danger of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; cried Pierre des Anbiez, &ldquo;we must send at once for Brother
      Anselm, the surgeon on board my galley. He will assist you; he understands
      wounds made by weapons of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Luquin Trinquetaille at the door, the commander said to him: &ldquo;Go
      immediately for Brother Anselm, and bring him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin disappeared to execute the commander&rsquo;s orders. The abbé was
      anxiously listening to the laboured breathing of the baron. Finally, the
      wounded man made a light movement, turned his head from the chaplain
      without opening his eyes, and uttered a long sigh. The commander and the
      priest gazed inquiringly into the chaplain&rsquo;s face, who made a sign of
      approval, and took advantage of the baron&rsquo;s position to dress another part
      of the wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear, disappointed at not seeing Reine at her father&rsquo;s bedside at
      such a time, said, in a low voice to Honorât: &ldquo;And where is Reine? The
      poor child no doubt cannot endure this painful sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; cried Honorât, in astonishment, &ldquo;and do you not know, Father
      Elzear, all the misfortunes which have befallen this house? Reine has been
      carried off by the pirates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear and the commander looked at each other, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God! spare his old age this last blow!&rdquo; said the priest,
      clasping his hands in supplication, and looking up to heaven. &ldquo;Grant us
      the power to take this unfortunate child from their hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does no one know to what point these pirates have fled?&rdquo; said the
      commander, his wrath beyond all bounds. &ldquo;Inquire of the boats that arrive;
      the night was clear, and they must be able to give us some information.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Honorât, &ldquo;I have just arrived at Maison-Forte, which I and
      the baron&rsquo;s guests left that night in peace. I was ignorant of all these
      disasters. When the baron was brought home unconscious, the good abbé sent
      for me in haste, and I came, finding him in this desperate state, and his
      vassals informed me of the abduction of Mlle, des Anbiez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. still lay unconscious. From time to time he uttered a feeble
      sigh, and then relapsed into a lethargic torpor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander anxiously awaited the coming of the surgeon from his galley,
      as he thought his medical attainments superior to those of the chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he arrived, followed by Luquin Trinquetaille, who, notwithstanding
      the profound silence guarded by the watchers around the wounded man, cried
      out to the commander, as he entered the door: &ldquo;Monseigneur, the pirates
      must be anchored on the coast, twenty-five or thirty leagues from here at
      the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez, making a sign to the worthy captain to be silent,
      walked up to him rapidly, and conducted him into the gallery, which the
      vassals had just left at the chaplain&rsquo;s request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; said he to Trinquetaille. &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, the coxswain Nicard told me. That night he passed very near
      to two galleys and a chebec, which hugged the shore, and he easily
      recognised the <i>Red Galleon</i>. These vessels were moving very, very
      slowly, as if they had been so badly damaged as to be compelled to halt
      every few minutes in some deserted harbour on the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be so,&rdquo; said the commander, thoughtfully, &ldquo;they must have been
      seriously crippled to stay near the shore, instead of flying south with
      their captives and their booty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt, monseigneur, that the culverin of Maison-Forte did
      them great damage, for Pierron, the fisherman, told me that he saw them
      fire that artillery the whole time the galleys of those demons were
      doubling the point of the island Verte, and that pass is a fine aim for
      the culverin; Master Laramée has told me so a thousand times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vengeance of the Lord will overtake these robbers, glutted with blood
      and pillage,&rdquo; said the commander, in a hollow voice. &ldquo;Perhaps I shall be
      able to snatch my brother&rsquo;s unfortunate daughter from their hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also her attendant, Stephanette, if you please, monseigneur,&rdquo; said
      Luquin. &ldquo;These brigands, no doubt, have carried her off with the aid of a
      cursed Bohemian, that the good God will send some day, perhaps, within
      reach of my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a moment to lose,&rdquo; said the commander, after a few moments&rsquo; 
      reflection. Then addressing Luquin, he said: &ldquo;Run to the port, and issue
      my order to the king of the chevaliers to prepare my galley for immediate
      departure. Do you follow with your polacre. Where did the coxswain Nicard
      meet the <i>Red Galleon?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near the island of St. Fereol, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we only need to watch the coast this side of the island of St.
      Fereol As soon as you put to sea, set all your sails so as to examine
      every point on the coast which may serve as a retreat for the pirates. If
      you see anything suspicious, give me warning. I will keep in sight of your
      vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven bless your undertaking, monseigneur, and grant that I may be
      able to aid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin Trinquetaille, inspired by the hope of recovering Stephanette, and
      eager to wreak his vengeance upon the Bohemian, ran to the port in all
      possible haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez returned to the baron&rsquo;s chamber. The surgeon from the
      galley already saw signs of hope in the improved respiration and more
      quiet sleep of the wounded man. The commander gazed sadly and thoughtfully
      at his brother. Presentiments he could not conquer told him that this day
      would prove a fatal one to him. It grieved him much to leave the baron
      without being recognised by him, but time pressed, and he approached the
      bed, leaned over the patient, and, kissing his cold cheeks, said, in a low
      and broken voice: &ldquo;Farewell, my poor brother, farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he rose, his hard and austere countenance betrayed his emotion, and a
      tear flowed down his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Embrace me, my brother,&rdquo; said he to Elzear, &ldquo;I am going into battle, and
      into a bloody battle, for the <i>Red Galleon</i> is intrepid. I hope to
      meet these pirates in some harbour on the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Commander, I shall follow you,&rdquo; cried Honorât de Berrol, &ldquo;although it
      pains me to leave Raimond V. at such a time. I ask you to accept me as a
      volunteer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez seemed agitated by an inward struggle. He recognised the
      courage of Honorât, but he also realised the danger of the enterprise he
      was about to undertake, and foresaw that it would result in one of the
      most desperate encounters in which they had ever taken part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your interest,&rdquo; said he to Honorât. &ldquo;We will meet the
      pirates, and succeed, perhaps, in rescuing Reine des Anbiez, but if I do
      not return, and if his daughter should not return, who will console him?&rdquo;
       and he pointed to the baron. &ldquo;Does he not love you as a second son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you do not return, and if his daughter does not return,&rdquo; eried
      Honorât, &ldquo;who will console me for not having followed you, and for not
      having shared your dangers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said the commander, &ldquo;I cannot combat your noble resolution
      any longer. Let us go. Farewell, again, my brother, pray for us,&rdquo; added
      the soldier, tenderly embracing his brother Elzear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! may the Lord bless your undertaking. God grant you may bring our
      dear child back to us, and our brother, waking from the painful sleep, may
      find his daughter kneeling at his bedside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven hear you, brother!&rdquo; said the commander. For the last time he
      pressed the cold hand of Raimond V., and hurried out of the chamber toward
      the port There he found his galley ready to depart, and set sail at once,
      followed by the polacre of the brave Trinquetaille.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that the black galley found itself in sight of the Bay of
      Lérins, where the two galleys of the pirates were anchored, when Hadji
      came out of the road with his chebec to execute the orders of Pog, and
      lead in pursuit of him the galley of religion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. PREPARATIONS FOR THE COMBAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wind was favourable for the black galley and the polacre, and after
      having passed the island of Lerol the two vessels slackened their speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luquin Trinquetaille touched at the different harbours along the coast,
      without meeting the pirate ships, which he was to announce to the
      commander by a shot from his swivel-gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening, just as the sun was sinking below the horizon, the black
      galley and the polacre arrived in sight of the isles of Ste. Marguerite,
      at the moment, as we have just said, when the chebec of Hadji issued from
      the road, in quest of the Christian galleys, in obedience to the commands
      of Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Trinquetaille signalled the chebec, and set every sail to join it.
      The Bohemian slackened his speed and waited for him. The betrothed of
      Stephanette, by the aid of his telescope, recognised Hadji, who was
      commanding the little craft. The worthy captain of the <i>Holy Terror to
      the Moors</i> boiled with rage at this encounter, and had need of all his
      self-control not to attack the author of Stephanette&rsquo;s abduction, but,
      faithful to the orders of the commander, he doubled the point of Lerol,
      and soon perceived the <i>Red Galleon</i> and the galley of Trimalcyon
      anchored in the bay, very near each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus having obtained an exact knowledge of the position of the pirates, he
      stood toward the black galley in order to announce this discovery to
      Pierre des Anbiez, while the chebec of Hadji was entering the bay under
      full sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived near the stem of the black galley and gave this
      information to the pilot, the latter, in obedience to the commander,
      ordered him to set back the sails of the polacre, and come on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luquin obeyed, but was in despair to see that the chebec of Hadji, whom he
      was burning to fight, had escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevaliers had assembled on the deck of the galley, and, according to
      the methods of warfare of that time, had cleared the deck for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rambades, which formed a sort of forecastle at the prow, where the
      five pieces of artillery belonging to the galley were in battery, were
      already covered with coarse oakum cloth, several inches in thickness. This
      heavy covering was designed to deaden the effect of the enemy&rsquo;s
      projectiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the galley was boarded by the enemy, an entrenchment called a
      bastion had been erected, which extended the entire length of the ship&rsquo;s
      balcony, and reached to the height of the fourth bench of the prow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This entrenchment was constructed of beams and crosspieces of timber, the
      spaces between being filled with old cordage and dilapidated sails. This
      construction, six feet high on the side of the stem, was only five feet
      high at the prow, toward which it sloped to the level of the rambades, and
      was designed to prevent the raking fire of the enemy&rsquo;s artillery, sweeping
      the length of the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subordinate officers and soldiers were armed with steel helmets,
      buff-skin, and neck-pieces of iron. Matches ready for lighting lay near
      the cannon and swivel-guns; the masts had been hauled down and placed in
      the waist of the vessel, as galleys never fight with sails up, but are
      sustained by their oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slaves who composed the crew looked on these preparations for battle
      with mute terror or sullen indifference. These poor creatures, chained to
      their benches, were accounted only a locomotive power. The discipline of
      force, to which they had been subjected on board the galley, had, through
      its severity, given them the calmness necessary for confronting danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their position was one of peculiar trial. The gagged and passive
      spectators of a desperate battle,&mdash;since during a conflict the crews
      were generally gagged by means of a piece of wood inserted in the mouth,&mdash;they
      were not able to deaden their perception of danger, or satisfy that
      instinct of ferocity which self-preservation always awakens in men at the
      sight of carnage, that enthusiasm or courage which demands blow for blow,
      and kills in order not to be killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had these slaves any hope of the ordinary results which follow a
      victory. If their vessel was the conqueror they continued to row on board
      of her; if she was conquered, they rowed on board of the conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed during the action between the balls of the enemy and the pistols of
      their keepers, who killed them on their first refusal to row, the men of
      the crew only escaped certain death by exposing themselves to a death less
      certain, inasmuch as there was a possibility of missing the enemy&rsquo;s balls,
      while the keepers fired their pistols into the breasts of their helpless
      victims. Under such an alternative the galley-slaves resigned themselves
      to their fate and continued to row.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all cases, they were indifferent to victory, and not unfrequently were
      interested in defeat, since the conquerors, Turks or Arabs, often
      delivered their own nationality. As to the renegades, all crews were alike
      to them. Hence, the convict-crew of the black galley knew only that they
      were about to do battle with the <i>Red Galleon</i>, and were utterly
      indifferent to the result of the engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparations for the fight went on in the most profound silence. The calm,
      austere countenances of the soldiers of the cross showed that they found
      nothing unusual in these preliminary details. The chevaliers carefully
      inspected the different services with which they were charged; so
      seriously was every duty performed, that one might have thought the actors
      were preparing for some religious rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the stern, the assembled chevaliers made a rigid examination of the
      position of the two galleys commanded by the pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Luquin Trinquetaille arrived on deck, the overseer ordered him to
      attend the commander, who was expected there. Pierre des Anbiez, kneeling
      in his chamber, was fervently praying. Since his departure from
      Maison-Forte, the gloomiest presentiments had assailed his mind. In the
      poignancy of his remorse, he had seen a providential coincidence in his
      return and the frightful disasters which had just overwhelmed his family.
      He accused himself of having, by his own crime, called down the vengeance
      of Heaven upon the house of Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      His imagination, unnaturally excited by the violent emotions which had
      shaken his whole being, evoked the strangest phantoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he cast a serious yet fearful glance upon the portrait of Pog,&mdash;the
      Count de Montreuil,&mdash;which was hanging in his chamber, it seemed to
      him that the eyes of this portrait glowed with a supernatural brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice he approached the frame to assure himself that he was not the sport
      of an illusion; twice he recoiled terrified, feeling his brow bathed in a
      cold sweat, and his hair standing up on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was struck with dizziness,&mdash;his reason forsook him,&mdash;he
      saw nothing more. Objects unnamable passed before his eyes with frightful
      rapidity; it seemed to him that he was being transported on the wings of a
      whirlwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees he came to himself,&mdash;the aberration was past, and he found
      himself in his chamber on the galley, face to face with the portrait of
      Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life he felt a dark and painful presentiment at
      the thought of going into battle. Instead of burning with that wild
      enthusiasm which characterised him, instead of thinking with a sort of
      ferocious joy upon the tumult of the fray, which had so often stifled the
      remorse which cried aloud in his soul, his thoughts turned involuntarily
      to death and disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, as he asked himself if his soul was ready to appear before the
      Lord,&mdash;if the austerities which he had imposed upon himself for so
      many years sufficed for the expiation of his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrified, he fell upon his knees, and began to pray with fervour,
      beseeching God to give him the courage and the strength to accomplish his
      last mission,&mdash;once more to uplift the cross triumphantly, and to
      rescue Reine des Anbiez from the hands of her ravishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely finished his prayer when some one knocked at his door. He
      rose to his feet. The artilleryman, Captain Hugues, appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in a boat, sent by these miscreants, wishes to make some terms with
      you. M. Commander, must I welcome him with a shot from my swivel-gun, or
      send him on deck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him on deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I conduct him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez thought he understood the nature of the desired
      interview. The pirates, holding Reine des Anbiez as a hostage, wished, no
      doubt, to make terms for her ransom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artillery officer returned with the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said the commander to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order this man to retire, monseigneur; your ears alone should hear what
      my lips will say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very impudent,&rdquo; replied Pierre de Anbiez, looking at Hadji,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he added, addressing Captain Hugues: &ldquo;Leave us&mdash;go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone with this robber, M. Commander?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are three,&rdquo; said Pierre des Anbiez, pointing to his arms hanging on
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you take me, then, for an assassin?&rdquo; said Hadji, with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artillery officer shrugged his shoulders, and went out with evident
      regret, although the tall stature and robust figure of the commander,
      compared to the slender proportions of the Bohemian, ought to have
      reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, as I do not wish to have you crucified yet at the prow of my
      galley,&rdquo; said Pierre des Anbiez to the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, with his accustomed insolence, replied: &ldquo;When my hour comes it
      shall find me. Pog-Reis, captain of the <i>Red Galleon</i>, sends me to
      you, monseigneur. It was he who attacked La Ciotat that night; it is he
      certainly who has Reine des Anbiez in his power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, enough, wretch, do not boast longer of your crimes, or I will
      have your tongue torn out! What have you come to demand? I am eager to
      chastise your accomplices and make a terrible example of them. If you come
      to speak of favour and ransom, hear well what fate awaits you and yours;
      let them try to defend themselves or not, they shall all be carried in
      chains to La Ciotat, and burned in the middle of the town hall square. Do
      you understand clearly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand clearly,&rdquo; said the Bohemian, with imperturbable coolness.
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis will not object to your burning his crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? That he will deliver his accomplices to me, if I grant
      him his life? It is natural that barbarity like his should hide an ignoble
      cowardice. If that is his opinion, I am of another mind. The two captains
      of the galleys and you, all three shall be quartered before being burned,
      even if you deliver to me your accomplices bound hand and foot, to receive
      the punishment they deserve. So, go at once, and tell that to your
      confederates. Go! my blood boils when I think of that unfortunate city and
      my brother! Go! I do not wish to soil my hands with the blood of a bandit,
      and I wish you to warn your associates of the fate which awaits them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had nothing to do with the massacre in the city, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you finish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, monseigneur, Pog-Reis and the other captain propose a single
      combat to you and one of your chevaliers, two against two, with the
      Spanish sword and dagger. If he is killed, you will attack his galleys
      afterward, and easily capture them, as there will then be two bodies
      without a head. If you are killed, your lieutenant will attack the galleys
      of Pog-Reis. The desire to avenge your death will give new zeal to your
      soldiers, and no doubt they will offer Pog-Reis and his crew as a
      holocaust to your ghost. That need not change your plans in the least;
      only the captain of the <i>Red Galleon</i> will find himself face to face
      with the captain of the black galley. The tiger and the lion can thus defy
      each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commander listened to this proposition, as insolent as it was unheard
      of, in silence and astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Bohemian ceased talking, Pierre des Anbiez, in his wrath, could
      not resist seizing him by the throat, and crying: &ldquo;What! you wretch, is
      that the message with which you are charged? You dare propose to me to
      cross swords with an assassin like Pog-Reis and one of his brigands! By
      the holy cross!&rdquo; added the commander, pushing back the Bohemian so
      violently that he stumbled to the other end of the chamber, &ldquo;to punish you
      for your impudence, I shall have you given twenty lashes on the chase-gun
      before handing you over to execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian darted the glance of a tiger at Pierre des Anbiez and gnashed
      his teeth together in rage, but seeing that he would be at a disadvantage
      in a contest, he restrained himself and replied: &ldquo;Pog-Reis, monseigneur,
      counted on your refusal at first, and, to decide you, he instructed me to
      inform you that your brother&rsquo;s daughter was in his power. If you refuse
      his proposition, if you attack his galleys at once, Reine des Anbiez and
      all the captives we have taken shall be instantly put to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, on the contrary, you accept the combat and send your gauntlet as a
      pledge, Reine des Anbiez will be brought on board your vessel without
      ransom, as well as the other prisoners that Pog-Reis has taken at La
      Ciotat.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will never make terms with such murderers. Go!&rdquo; &ldquo;Think of it,
      consider it, monseigneur. Pog-Reis, if you attack him, will defend himself
      vigorously. If he is defeated, he will blow up his ship. You will have
      neither him nor Reine des Anbiez nor the other captives, while by
      accepting this single combat you can return the young girl to her father,
      and the captives to their city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; said the commander, who could not help reflecting that this
      proposition had its advantage, notwithstanding its audacious insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; said Hadji, as if he had guarded this last consideration as the
      most decisive, &ldquo;a mysterious spirit wishes the combat that Pog-Reis
      proposes to you. Yes, this morning, after the attack on La Ciotat,
      Pog-Reis, exhausted by fatigue, fell asleep and had a dream. A voice said
      to him that a single combat between him and a soldier of the cross to-day
      would expiate a great crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These last words of the Bohemian struck the commander, and he started.
      Already he believed, in the intensity of his remorse, that his crime had
      brought upon his family the frightful evils which had befallen it. When he
      heard Hadji speak of the expiation of a great crime, he believed âiat the
      will of Heaven had been declared in these words, uttered by chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dream? what dream? speak,&rdquo; said he to the Bohemian, in a hollow
      voice, as he was seized by a secret terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matters the dream to you, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, I tell you, speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis was transported into the region of visions,&rdquo; replied Hadji, with
      an Oriental emphasis. &ldquo;He heard the voice of the spirit. It said to him,
      &lsquo;Look!&rsquo; and he saw a woman in a coffin, and that woman had been pierced to
      the heart and her wound was bleeding. And near the dead woman Pog-Reis
      beheld the vision of a soldier of Christ,&mdash;that vision was you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! I!&rdquo; cried the commander, petrified with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Hadji, restraining his joy, for he saw that this story,
      prepared by Pog-Reis, accomplished the desire of the pirate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog,&mdash;the Count de Montreuil,&mdash;judging of the religious
      character of the commander by the letters which the Bohemian had stolen
      from the watchman&rsquo;s cabin, did not doubt that Pierre des Anbiez would be
      impressed by this dream, and thus be induced to decide in favour of the
      combat. The commander was all the more impressed by this account of the
      dream, inasmuch as he believed his crime had never been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, God wishes it, God wishes it,&rdquo; murmured he, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian continued without appearing to hear him: &ldquo;The spirit said to
      Pog, &lsquo;Tomorrow you will fight this soldier of Christ, one to one, and a
      great crime will be expiated.&rsquo; Pog-Reis has committed great crimes,
      monseigneur, he has never felt remorse, the revelation of the spirit has
      touched him, and he wishes to obey it. He offers you combat. Take care not
      to refuse it. Christian, the God of all sends his dreams to all
      indiscriminately. It is by dreams that he declares his will. Perhaps, he
      chooses you, holy man, as an instrument of a great vengeance; you ought to
      obey. Perhaps in asking combat of you, Pog-Reis asks for death at your
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The astonishment, the terror, of the commander can be comprehended. In
      these words, he saw a divine revelation; he thought he heard the voice of
      the Lord commanding this expiation, and, contrary to the prediction of the
      Bohemian, believed that the anger of Heaven had decreed himself to be the
      victim which should fall under the blows of Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in accepting the combat, he assured the rescue of Reine des
      Anbiez; he would return a daughter to her father, and prisoners to their
      weeping families,&mdash;a last proof that divine justice desired to strike
      him alone, since it offered him the means of repairing the evils his crime
      had called down upon his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reflect that the constant remorse of Pierre des Anbiez, while it
      did not impair his reason, had predisposed him to a sort of religious
      fatalism by no means orthodox, but calculated to make a deep impression
      upon his earnest and gloomy nature, we may comprehend the crushing effect
      produced on him by the language of Hadji.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he said to the Bohemian,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up on deck, I will give you my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he sent for the overseer, and commanded him to conduct Hadji on deck,
      to watch over him, and to take him under his protection.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. THE CHALLENGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The commander sent for the chaplain of the black galley to descend into
      his chamber. While Pierre des Anbiez confessed his sins,&mdash;with the
      exception of the murder reserved for the great act of penitence of the
      order,&mdash;and received absolution, the Bohemian went up on deck. The
      first person whom he met there was the captain of the <i>Holy Terror to
      the Moors, by the Grace of God</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji, affecting an easy and impertinent familiarity, approached Luquin
      Trinquetaille and said to him: &ldquo;Who would have believed, my boy, that we
      would see each other again here, when that pretty girl enraged you so much
      by giving me flame-coloured ribbons at Maison-Forte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This excess of impudence rendered the worthy captain speechless a moment,
      then, putting his hand on his sword, he was about to attack Hadji, when
      the overseer reminded him that the Bohemian was under his protection by
      order of the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another place where we will meet, you villain,&rdquo; said Luquin,
      &ldquo;and that will be under the gallows where you will be hanged; for, zounds!
      although the office of executioner is repugnant to me, I would sell my
      polacre even to have the right to put the rope around your neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ingrate, you do not think of the grief you would bring upon Stephanette;
      the poor girl loves me so much that she would die of sorrow to see me
      hanged, and especially by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, you lie like a dog. Oh, that I could tear your cursed tongue out
      by the roots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be right, my boy, to tear out my tongue, for it was my honeyed
      words which opened the way to this pretty girl&rsquo;s heart A little while ago,
      on board my chebec where she was with me, she said, as she leaned her head
      on my shoulder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, you blaspheme!&rdquo; cried Luquin, in fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said, as she leaned her head on my shoulder,&rdquo; continued the Bohemian,
      with imperturbable coolness, &ldquo;&lsquo;What a difference, my handsome captain,
      between your gallant and charming language, and the tiresome twittering of
      that long-legged heron that flutters around me so clumsily.&rsquo; That is the
      way she spoke of you, my poor boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, overseer,&rdquo; exclaimed Luquin, pale with rage, &ldquo;permit me to cut this
      villain&rsquo;s face with a few blows of my sabre scabbard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his words wound you, do not listen to them,&rdquo; answered the overseer.
      &ldquo;The commander entrusted this pagan to me, and I cannot permit any one to
      do him harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin uttered a groan of concentrated wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; continued the Bohemian, with a disdain-ful self-conceit,
      &ldquo;that girl is rather good-looking, but you have made her so silly, my boy,
      that the conversation I had with her yesterday was enough to take away any
      desire to continue the interview. You can marry her when you please, my
      boy, only when you see her look sad, you need only mention my name to make
      her smile tenderly, since the memory of me will live in her heart
      eternally. Poor girl, she told me so yesterday as she kissed my hand as if
      I had been a lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The indignant Luquin could hear no more. Shaking his fists at the
      Bohemian, he turned away abruptly, followed by the derisive laugh of the
      vagabond.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, the sun was just sinking and the sea was calm. In the
      distance, between two points of the rocks at the depth of the bay, could
      be seen the <i>Red Galleon</i> and the galley of Trimalcyon anchored near
      each other, while not far from them lay the chebec of Hadji.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat which had brought Hadji balanced on the waves, fastened to the
      stem of the black galley. The sky was clear, with the exception of a belt
      of reddish gray clouds around the setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hugues, the artilleryman, approached the overseer who guarded the
      Bohemian, and said to him, as he shook his head and pointed to the west:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, I do not like those clouds which are gathering down there, they
      are threatening, we are in a dead calm. If the sun, as it sets, scatters
      these clouds, the night will be beautiful; if, on the contrary, the cloud
      covers the sun before it sets&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, Brother Hugues, we will have a shift of the wind, a
      hurricane, and the night will be bad,&rdquo; replied the overseer. &ldquo;Fortunately,
      we have time yet.&rdquo; And, turning to Hadji, he said, &ldquo;Little it matters to
      you or to yours to be hanged in a storm or a calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to be hanged in a storm, overseer; the wind rocks you like a
      cradle, and you fall asleep sooner in eternity,&rdquo; replied Hadji, with a
      disdainful indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander appeared on deck. The assembled chevaliers separated and
      respectfully made way for him. Pierre des Anbiez was dressed entirely in
      black. His face seemed paler and more sad than usual. At his side he wore
      a heavy iron sword, and a long dagger in its bronze scabbard; on his right
      hand he wore a glove of black buffalo skin, his left hand was naked. He
      made a sign to the Bohemian and threw down before him his left gauntlet.
      Hadji picked it up and was about to speak, when the commander, with an
      imperious gesture, showed him the boat which had brought him to the
      galley. Hadji descended and embarked, and was soon on his way to the
      vessels of the pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished at the commander&rsquo;s action, the chevaliers and Honorât de
      Berrol, who was among them, looked at each other in surprise. The
      commander followed the Bohemian&rsquo;s departing boat with his eyes, then,
      turning to the group around him, said, in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brothers, in a little while we will attack the galleys of these
      miscreants; they are anchored near each other. The long-boat will be put
      to sea, half the soldiers will descend into it, and, while the black
      galley attacks the <i>Red Galleon</i>, the long-boat will attack the other
      pirate vessel.&rdquo; Then addressing the king of the chevaliers, he continued:
      &ldquo;You will command the black galley, brother, and the Brother de Blinville,
      the oldest lieutenant of the galley, will command the long-boat. Now,
      overseer, strokesman, all, ply your oars! the sun is setting and only an
      hour of daylight is left us to chastise these miscreants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the chevaliers had not understood why Pierre des Anbiez abandoned
      the command of the black galley and the long-boat, they hastened to
      execute his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of the crew, well armed, embarked in the longboat of the galley,
      which was put to sea under the orders of the Chevalier de Blinville, and
      the two vessels, with full force of oars, directed their course toward the
      entrance of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander having ordered Captain Trinquetaille to remain on board the
      galley, the polacre was directed by the second in command, and followed
      the black galley&rsquo;s movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât approached the commander, and said: &ldquo;I wish to fight at your side,
      M. Commander. Reine des Anbiez was my betrothed. Raimond V. has been a
      second father to me, and my place should be the post of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez looked steadily at Honorât, and answered: &ldquo;It is true,
      chevalier, you have a double vengeance to wreak upon these robbers. To
      assure the freedom of Reine, I have consented to fight in single combat
      with one of the pirate captains. I need a second. Will you accept that
      duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, monsieur, you accede to such a proposition!&rdquo; cried Honorât, &ldquo;do such
      honour to these miscreants!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you or will you not draw the sword and the dagger when I draw them,
      young man?&rdquo; rudely interrupted Pierre des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only be proud to do what you do, M. Commander; my sword is at your
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, then, and arm yourself, and hold yourself in readiness to follow me
      when I descend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he added: &ldquo;You see that long-boat doubling the
      point; she will bring on board my galley Reine des Anbiez and the captives
      from La Ciotat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reine!&rdquo; cried Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; said the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the long-boat of Hadji was rapidly approaching; the Chevalier de
      Berrol soon recognised Reine, Stephanette, and two other young girls,
      besides twenty inhabitants of La Ciotat, captured when the pirates made
      their descent upon the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevaliers were ignorant of the agreement made between the commander
      and the Bohemian. They could not understand why the pirates returned their
      prisoners in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the long-boat was within range of the voice, the commander ordered
      the overseer to lift the galley&rsquo;s oars and wait for this craft, which soon
      reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez advanced to the height of the first rower&rsquo;s seat, and
      there received his niece, who threw herself in his arms with all the
      effusion oi affectionate gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my father?&rdquo; cried the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your return will relieve his anxiety, my child,&rdquo; replied the commander,
      who did not wish to inform Reine of her father&rsquo;s condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honorât, is it you?&rdquo; said Reine, extending her hand to the chevalier,
      whom she did not see at first &ldquo;Alas! my friend, under what sad
      circumstances I see you. But who is with my father, pray? Why did you
      leave him alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reine, our aim was to rescue you, and I followed the commander. Father
      Elzear is at Maison-Forte with Raimond V.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now I am free, will you not return with me to my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return with you? No, Reine, I must remain with the commander. To-morrow,
      no doubt, I will see you. I bid you a tender farewell, Reine. Farewell,
      farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what a serious air you bid me farewell, Honorât,&rdquo; cried the young
      girl, struck with the chevalier&rsquo;s solemn expression. &ldquo;But there is no
      danger, they will not attack the pirates; what good can be done by
      remaining here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, doubtless they will not fight,&rdquo; said Honorât, with embarrassment &ldquo;The
      commander only wishes to assure the departure of these wretches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez, having given his orders, approached Reine and took her
      by the hand, as he said: &ldquo;Come, hasten, my child; embark at once, the sun
      is sinking. Luquin Trinquetaille will take you on board his polacre, and
      before to-morrow morning you will be in the arms of your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then addressing the captain of the <i>Holy Terror to the Moors</i>, who
      was darting furious glances at the Bohemian because this vagabond never
      took his eyes from Stephanette, and affected to speak to her in a low
      voice, the commander said: &ldquo;With your life you will answer for Mlle, des
      Anbiez. Depart this instant. Conduct her to Maison-Forte with the other
      young girls and her attendant. The men will remain and reinforce the crew
      of my galley. Come, farewell, Reine, embrace me, my child; say to my
      brothers that I hope to take them by the hand to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hope, uncle,&mdash;pray, what danger is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun is setting, embark at once,&rdquo; said the commander, without replying
      to the question of his niece, as he led her to the boat which was to
      conduct her to the polacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Reine exchanged a last look with Honorât, the Bohemian, still
      insolent and satirical, approached Luquin, holding Stephanette&rsquo;s hand in
      spite of her resistance, and said to him: &ldquo;I give you this pretty girl, my
      boy; marry her in all confidence. Alas! my poor little thing, I must
      resign you. I will remember all your tenderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! my tenderness!&rdquo; cried Stephanette, indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true we agreed to say nothing about it before this cormorant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luquin, to your boat!&rdquo; cried the commander, in an imperious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy captain was compelled to swallow this new insult, and to
      descend in haste to his boat in order to receive there Mlle. des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after the polacre, commanded by Luquin, set sail for
      Maison-Forte, bearing Reine, Stephanette, and two other young girls so
      miraculously saved from the fate which threatened them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the polacre had departed, the Bohemian approached the commander
      respectfully, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pog-Reis has kept his word, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep mine. Go, wait for me in your longboat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian bowed and left the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez said to the Chevalier de Blinville, who was to command
      the galley in his absence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hour-glass is full; in a half-hour, if I do not return on board, you
      are to enter the bay and attack the pirates according to the orders which
      I have given to you; the black galley will fight the <i>Red Galleon</i>,
      and the boat will fight the other vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we begin the attack without waiting for you, M. Commander?&rdquo;
       repeated the lieutenant, thinking he had not understood the instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will begin the attack without waiting for me, if I do not return in a
      half-hour,&rdquo; replied the commander, in a firm voice. One of his men brought
      to him his hat and large black mantle, on which was quartered the white
      cross of his order. He then left the galley, followed by Honorât, to the
      great astonishment of the chevaliers and the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadji stood at the helm of the little boat; four Moorish slaves took the
      oars, and soon the light craft bounded over the swelling waves in the
      direction of the western point of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez, wrapped in his mantle, turned his head and threw a last
      lingering look upon his galley, as if to assure himself of the reality of
      the events which were taking place. He felt himself dragged, so to speak,
      by an irresistible force to which he submitted in blind obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some moments of silence, he said to Hadji: &ldquo;Where does that man
      expect me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the beach, near the ruins of the Abbey of St. Victor, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your crew row faster, they do not advance,&rdquo; said Pierre des Anbiez,
      with feverish impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waves are high, the cloud is gathering, and the wind is going to
      blow; the night will be bad,&rdquo; said Hadji, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander, absorbed in his own thoughts, did not reply to him. The
      sun&rsquo;s last rays were soon obscured by a large belt of black clouds, which,
      at first heavy and motionless upon the horizon, began to move with
      frightful rapidity. Deep and distant bursts of thunder, a phenomenon quite
      common during the winter season of Provence, announced one of those sudden
      hurricanes so frequent in the Mediterranean.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. THE COMBAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The clouds piled high in the west, spread rapidly over the sky which had
      been so serene. The increasing murmur of the waves, the plaintive moan of
      the wind, which was gradually rising, the distant rolling of the thunder,
      all announced a terrible storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boat reached the shore, a lonely beach girded by blocks of
      reddish granite. The commander and Honorât landed, when Hadji, who had
      preceded them a few steps, stopped and said to Pierre des Anbiez,
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, follow this path hollowed out of the rock, and you will soon
      arrive at the ruins of the Abbey of St. Victor. Pog-Reis awaits you
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without replying to Hadji, Pierre des Anbiez resolutely entered a sort of
      crevasse formed by a rent in the rock, and scarcely large enough for a man
      to pass through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât, not less courageous, followed him, reflecting at the same time
      that a traitor, placed on the crest of the two rocks between which they
      rather glided than walked, could easily crush them by rolling upon them
      some one of the enormous stones which crowned the escarpment. The tempest
      was gradually approaching. The loud voices of the wind and the sea, which
      threatened more and more, at last burst forth into fury, and were answered
      from the height of the clouds by the thunderbolts. The elements had
      entered upon a tremendous struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander walked with long strides. In the violence of the storm he
      saw an omen; it seemed to him that the vengeance of Heaven clothed itself
      in a terrible majesty before striking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he reflected, the more the strange dream related by the Bohemian
      appeared to him a manifestation of the divine will.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one of the ordinary phenomena of thought, Pierre des Anbiez in one
      second recalled every detail of bloody tragedy which was the consequence
      of his love for the wife of Count de Montreuil, the birth of his
      unfortunate child, the death of Emilie, and the murder of her husband. All
      of these events came back to his mind with awful precision, as if the
      crime had been committed the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrow passage which wound across the rocks enlarged somewhat, and the
      commander and Honorât issued from this granite wall, and found themselves
      opposite the ruins of the Abbey of St. Victor. In this spot they beheld no
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior basin of the bay formed a deep cove. At the south it was shut
      in by the rocks through which they had just passed; at the north and at
      the west, by the half-destroyed buildings of the abbey; at the east could
      be seen the road in which the two galleys of the pirates were anchored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imposing pile of the abbey ruins, the wreck of vaults and heavy
      arches, the crumbling towers covered with ivy, outlined their sad, gray
      forms upon the black clouds which hung lower and lower over the solemn
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wan, bleak day, which was neither light nor darkness, threw a strange
      and weird radiance over the rocks, the ruins, the beach, and the sea. The
      waves roared, the wind howled, the thunder rolled, yet no person appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât, in spite of his courage, was struck with the awful and dismal
      scene which lay around him. The commander, wrapped in his long black
      mantle, his form erect, his face anxious and gloomy, seemed to evoke evil
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a deep, sepulchral voice, he called three times: &ldquo;Pog-Reis! Pog-Reis!
      Pog-Reis!&rdquo; No answer was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      An enormous owl uttered a doleful cry as it flew slowly and heavily from a
      vault, as massive as the arch of a bridge, which had once been the
      entrance to the cloister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody comes,&rdquo; said Honorât. &ldquo;Do you not fear an ambuscade, M. Commander?
      Perhaps you have placed too much confidence in the words of these
      wretches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divine vengeance assumes all forms,&rdquo; replied Pierre des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then relapsed into silence, gazing abstractedly at the heavy arcade,
      which formerly served as an entrance to the cloister, and whose interior
      was now enveloped in dense shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a pale winter ray threw its wan light over this arch, casting a
      livid, fantastic illumination over the solemn scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thunderbolt broke and reverberated, and, by a strange coincidence, at
      the same moment two men issued from the obscurity of the vault, and with
      slow and deliberate steps advanced toward the commander and Honorât de
      Berrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men were Pog and Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog held a naked sword in his right hand; his left arm was around the neck
      of Erebus, and he reclined tenderly upon the young man, as a father would
      lean upon a son. Erebus also held an unsheathed sword in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both continued to approach the commander and Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Pierre des Anbiez stood for a moment petrified, then, without
      uttering a word, quickly stepped back, seized the arm of the Chevalier de
      Berrol, and pointed to Pog and Erebus, with a gesture of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the change produced by years in the countenance of Pog,
      the commander recognised in him the Count de Montreuil, the husband of
      Emilie, the man whom he believed he had killed, and whose portrait he had
      preserved as an expiation of his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the dead come back from the grave?&rdquo; said he, in a low voice,
      recoiling and dragging Honorât with him as Pog advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier de Berrol was ignorant of all that pertained to that
      terrible tragedy, but he felt a secret horror, less at the appearance of
      the two pirates than at the evident fright of the commander, whose
      intrepidity was so well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if to render the solemn scene still more awful, the tempest
      increased in violence, and the thunder grew louder and more frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know me? Do you know me?&rdquo; said he to the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not a ghost, I know you,&rdquo; replied the commander, fixing a look
      of amazement upon the husband of Emilie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the unhappy woman whose murderer you were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember, I remember, I accuse myself.&rdquo; And the commander struck his
      breast in the act of contrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, uttered in a low voice by Pierre des Anbiez, Erebus, whose
      countenance expressed the rage of desperation, raised his sword, and
      started to throw himself upon the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog restrained him with a firm hand, and said to him: &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus rested the point of his sword on the ground, and raised his eyes to
      heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe me a bloody reparation,&rdquo; said Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life belongs to you. I shall not lift my sword against you,&rdquo; replied
      the commander, bowing his head upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have accepted the combat. I have your word. Here is your adversary,&rdquo;
       and he pointed to Erebus. &ldquo;Here is mine,&rdquo; and he pointed to Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take up your sword, then,&rdquo; cried the Chevalier do Berrol, who wished at
      any cost to put an end to a scene which, in spite of himself, chilled him
      with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced toward Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They first, we afterward,&rdquo; answered Pog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This instant, this instant! Take up your sword!&rdquo; cried Honorât.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, addressing Pierre des Anbiez, said, in an imperious tone: &ldquo;Order your
      second to await the result of your fight with the young captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chevalier, I pray you to wait,&rdquo; said the commander, with resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defend your life, murderer!&rdquo; cried Erebus, rushing upon Pierre des Anbiez
      with uplifted sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is a child!&rdquo; said the commander, looking at his adversary with a
      sort of contemptuous compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother! Your mother!&rdquo; whispered Pog to Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a child, the child of those whom you have murdered,&rdquo; cried the
      unfortunate youth, striking the commander in the face with the breadth of
      his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The livid countenance of the old soldier became purple; transported with
      anger at this insult, he threw himself upon Erebus, saying, &ldquo;Lord, thy
      will be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then ensued a parricidal struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the darkness suddenly fell upon the scene, as if nature herself
      revolted at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thunderbolts rent the clouds, the tempest let loose its fury, and the very
      rocks trembled upon their foundations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parricidal combat continued with undiminished rage.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      With clasped hands, Pog, with ferocious eagerness, enjoyed the frightful
      spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, after twenty years, I taste one moment of true, ineffable
      happiness. Roll, O thunder! Burst forth, O tempest! All nature takes part
      in my vengeance!&rdquo; cried he, in savage joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorât, unable to account for his own feelings, cried in dismay:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! enough!&rdquo; and tried to separate Erebus and Pierre des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pog, endowed for the moment with superhuman strength, seized Honorât,
      paralysed his efforts, and said, in a low voice, trembling with rage and
      excitement, &ldquo;My vengeance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erebus fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre des Anbiez, you have killed your son! Here are your letters, here
      are the portraits, you can see them,&rdquo; cried Pog, in a voice that rose
      above the storm, and he threw at the feet of the commander the casket
      which Hadji had stolen from Peyrou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a thunderbolt struck with a noise impossible to describe. The
      heavens, the bay, the ruins, the rocks, and the sea, appeared to be on
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrible explosion followed, and the very earth trembled; a part of the
      ruins of the abbey fell away, while a blast of wind, breaking and driving
      everything in its path, enveloped the entire bay in its irresistible and
      tremendous whirlpool.

      CHAPTER XLII. CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days after the dreadful combat between Pierre des Anbiez and Erebus,
      the black galley and the polacre of Luquin were anchored in the port of La
      Ciotat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great clock in the hall of Maison-Forte had just struck nine. Captain
      Trinquetaille was walking softly on tiptoe through the gallery where the
      Christmas ceremonies had taken place, directing his steps toward the
      apartment of Mlle. des Anbiez. He knocked at the little door of the
      oratory. Stephanette soon came out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, Luquin,&rdquo; said the young girl, anxiously,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;how has he passed the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly, Stephanette, very badly; the abbé says there is no hope for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said the young girl, &ldquo;and how is M. Commander?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always in the same state, seated at the youth&rsquo;s bedside like a statue; he
      never moves or speaks or sees or hears. Father Elzear says if M. Commander
      could only weep, he might be saved, if not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, he fears his head,&rdquo; and Luquin made a gesture indicating the
      alarm felt for the commander&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my God, if that misfortune should be added to all the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is Mlle. Reine?&rdquo; asked Luquin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always suffering. The sad ceremony of the baptism yesterday affected her
      so deeply! Monseigneur wished her to be with him sponsor to this poor
      young pagan whom they called Erebus, so that he can die a Christian. My
      God! at his age never to have been baptised! Fortunately, Father Elzear
      has given him the sacrament! Ah, poor young man, he will bear the
      Christian names that monseigneur and mademoiselle have given him only
      until this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is monseigneur?&rdquo; asked Luquin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to monseigneur, he would be on his feet and with the commander if
      we would listen to him. Abbé Mascarolus says an ordinary man would have
      been killed by such a wound, and that monseigneur must have a head as hard
      as iron to have resisted that heavy club. Thank God, he who gave that blow
      will not give any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of that, Stephanette, you know they have not been able to find
      the body of Pog-Reis under the ruins of the abbey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was only an infidel, but, oh, to die without burial!&rdquo; said
      Stephanette, with a shudder. &ldquo;How was he buried under the ruins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what M. Honorât told me, and he ought to know. The moment the
      unfortunate young man fell, wounded by the commander, Pog-Reis, as they
      called him, seized M. Honorât, so as to prevent his separating the two
      combatants. Suddenly, as you know, the thunderbolt burst in the middle of
      the bay It struck the <i>Red Galleon</i>; her powder took fire, and she
      was blown up, and carried with her the other galley, already seriously
      damaged by the culverin of Master Laramée. Not a pirate escaped. The waves
      of the bay were so high and so powerful that the best swimmer would have
      been drowned a thousand times over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pog-Reis?&rdquo; asked Stephanette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The explosion was so tremendous that the earth trembled. M. Honorât told
      me this: &lsquo;The pirate, startled, then left me. I ran to the commander, who
      had already been thrown on the body of his son. He was embracing him, as
      he sobbed. At the time of the explosion Pog-Reis was standing on the
      ruins. Those old walls, shaken by the commotion and violence of the wind,
      suddenly fell and crushed him beneath their weight&rsquo; This morning, some
      fishermen coming from the bay said the stones were so enormous that they
      could not be moved, and so they had given up all hope of finding the body
      of the brigand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God! What a disaster, Luquin, and how it proves that Heaven is
      just See, the two galleys of these brigands were struck and not one
      escaped! And Pog-Reis crushed under the ruins of the abbey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, no doubt, Stephanette, Heaven has done much; but it has not
      done all, there remains yet another account to settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we heard this explosion at sea, and when we set sail for
      Maison-Forte, and a little faster, too, than I wished, for the tempest was
      driving my polacre over the waves like a feather in the air, you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Luquin, we thought we were lost What weather! what waves!
      we thought we had escaped one danger only to fall into another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Ah, well, what was it passed within range of my cannon during
      the hurricane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? I was too much frightened and too much occupied with my
      mistress to see what was happening around us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Stephanette! Ah, well, it was the chebec of that cursed Bohemian
      whom hell leaves on this earth I know not why. Yes, it was his chebec that
      was near us. He had, by chance, anchored his ship so far from the galleys
      that he did not feel the explosion. Two hours after, when he had brought
      M. Commander, M. Honorât, and that poor young man on board the galley,
      taking advantage of the commander&rsquo;s forgetfulness, who neglected to have
      him hanged, he had the audacity to set sail again, and it was he we saw
      pass us, returning, no doubt, to the south, where he will be drowned or
      burned if the good God wishes to finish the example he has already given
      us in destroying the two galleys of these infidels. That is what I wish
      may happen to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Luquin, you are so enraged against this wretch; do not think
      of him any more. Yet it was he who brought on board the black galley Mlle.
      Reine, me, my companions, the prisoners, the recorder Isnard and his
      clerk, who were among the captives, and who never ceased to call him our
      deliverer. So do have a little pity on your neighbour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My neighbour! that miserable vagabond! My neighbour! the neighbour of
      Satan! That is what he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how wicked you are in your hatred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now, that is pretty good!&rdquo; cried Luquin, in a fury, &ldquo;that is the
      way you defend him now! You can do no more than regret him. Besides, he
      said, really, that you would regret him, and perhaps he was not wrong!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Indeed, if you begin your jealousy again, you will make me regret him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regret him&mdash;him! you dare&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt; for at least, one time in his ship, he left me to weep and
      grieve in peace, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was not what he said. H&rsquo;m&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;the honeyed words of
      this insolent prattler were quite capable of making you forget your grief
      for a time, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanette, indignant, was about to reply to her betrothed, when the
      whistle of Mlle, des Anbiez called her to that lady&rsquo;s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered, after having thrown an angry glance at Luquin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was in the way of repenting of his suspicions when the
      majordomo Laramée, coming precipitately out of the chamber of Raimond V.,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, Luquin, come quick and help me to carry monseigneur to the
      commander. He is too weak to walk; we will carry him in his armchair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luquin followed Laramée, and entered the baron&rsquo;s chamber. The old
      gentleman was still very pale, a wide black bandage wrapped his head, but
      he had partly recovered his vivacity and his energy. Abbé Mascarolus was
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say, then, abbé, that this poor young man is about to die, and he
      wishes to speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is my brother Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the same state, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick, Laramée, throw a mantle over my shoulders, and I will walk
      on your legs and the legs of this boy, for my own will not support me
      yet.&rdquo; Luquin took the armchair on one side, and Laramée took the other,
      and they transported the baron into the large chamber where Erebus was
      lying. At the door of this chamber they found Peyrou, the watchman, who
      anxiously awaited news from his old captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Erebus already gave signs of approaching death. His features,
      once so clear, so beautiful, so serene, were painfully contorted. He was
      pale with the pallor of the dying. His eyes shone with a brilliancy all
      the more intense because it was so soon to be eclipsed in death. His wound
      was mortal, and no place was left for hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez, wearing the same clothes he wore on the day of the
      fatal encounter, was seated on the foot of his son&rsquo;s bed, absolutely
      motionless, his head bowed on his breast, his hands on his knees, his gaze
      fixed upon the floor; since the day before he had kept this position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear, seated by the pillow of Erebus, leaned over him, lifted the
      poor young man&rsquo;s heavy head, and pressed it tenderly to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. made his bearers place him near the bed. Luquin and Laramée
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God will forgive me, will he not, good priest?&rdquo; said Erebus, in a feeble
      voice, to Father Elzear. &ldquo;He will have pity on my ignorance, and look only
      at my zeal. Alas! I have known the true faith but two-days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope, hope in his infinite compassion, my child, you are a Christian now.
      Two days of repentance and faith will atone for many sins. It is the
      fervour and not the length of the repentance which touches the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I would die with one hope more, if my father could forgive me also,&rdquo;
       said Erebus, bitterly. Then he cried, in a frenzy, &ldquo;Oh, a curse on
      Pog-Reis! Oh, why did he make me believe, as he showed me these portraits,
      that my father had been the murderer of my mother and of my family? Oh,
      how he excited all my bad passions! Alas! I believed him, because he who
      had always been so cruel wept, yes, he wept, as he pressed me to his heart
      and asked my forgiveness for all the evil he had done me. Then, seeing
      this implacable man weep as he embraced me, I believed him. I hoped the
      combat would be fatal to me. I knew Reine des Anbiez would be returned in
      safety to her father, hence I was able to die. And you&mdash;you&mdash;her
      father, will you forgive me, too?&rdquo; added Erebus, addressing Raimond V.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child, did you not save my life in the rocks of Ollioules? Although
      my daughter was in your power, did you not respect her and defend her? And
      are you not the son of my brother, after all? the son of a guilty love, of
      course, but, Manjour! you are of the family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Raimond&mdash;Raimond!&rdquo;
       said Father Elzear to his brother, softly, in a tone of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my father, my father does not hear me,&rdquo; said Erebus. &ldquo;I will die
      without his saying to me, &lsquo;My son!&rsquo;&rdquo; cried the unhappy youth, in a failing
      voice, and then with a sadden movement he sat up, threw his arms around
      the neck of Pierre des Anbiez, and letting his heavy head fall on the
      paternal bosom, he cried, &ldquo;My father, my father! Oh, hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This despairing, expiring cry, in which Erebes seemed to have concentrated
      all that remained of his strength, at last reached the depth of the heart
      of Pierre, des Anbiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander slowly raised his head, looked around him, then fixed his
      eyes on Erebus, who still hung around his neck. Then, pressing his son&rsquo;s
      head in his two hands, he kissed his forehead reverently and tenderly.
      Placing his son&rsquo;s head softly on the pillow, he said, in a low voice, with
      a strange smile, and an accent full of kindness: &ldquo;My child, you have
      called me, I heard your voice in the midst of darkness. I have come; now I
      return to it Farewell, sleep&mdash;sleep for ever, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he spread a cloth on the face of Erebus as is done for the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; cried Father Elzear, quickly removing the cloth and looking
      at the commander in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter did not seem to hear him; he fell back into a sort of lethargy
      from which he seemed unable to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus grew weaker and weaker, and said to Raimond V.:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One last favour before I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, speak, my child, I grant it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to see your daughter once more, she who gave me a Christian
      name. She too, alas! must forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reine, your cousin, your godmother? I consent to it with all my heart
      Elzear, my brother, will you go and tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your moments are numbered, you must think on God, my son,&rdquo; said Father
      Elzear to Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, let me see her, or I shall die in despair,&rdquo; said Erebus
      in such a heart-broken voice that Father Elzear went in search of Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. took both hands of his nephew in his own. Already they were
      cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not come,&rdquo; said Erebus, &ldquo;and yet I must&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice grew weaker, he could not continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine entered, accompanied by Father Elzear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus raised himself on his elbow; with his right hand he had the
      strength to break a little chain of gold he wore around his neck. He
      handed it to Reine, showing her, with a faint smile, the little enamelled
      dove that he had fastened to it, formerly taken from Reine in the rocks of
      Ollioules, and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I return it to you. Will you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will always wear this chain in memory of the day you saved the life of
      my father,&rdquo; replied Reine, full of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will wear it always?&rdquo; said Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always!&rdquo; replied Reine, bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I can die!&rdquo; said Erebus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A last ray seemed to illumine his face, as death slowly approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Father Elzear, in an austere voice, as he rose, &ldquo;this
      child is about to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. understood that the last moments of Erebus belonged to God. He
      embraced his nephew, called Luquin and Laramée to cany him, and went out
      with Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander remained silent and motionless, seated on the bed of his
      dying son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. sent Peyrou to him, hoping the watchman&rsquo;s presence might
      perhaps recall him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman, approaching Pierre des Anbiez, said to him, &ldquo;M. Commander,
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether the voice of Peyrou, which he had not heard for so long a time,
      impressed him all the more, or whether he obeyed an inexplicable instinct,
      the commander rose and followed the watchman, alas! without casting a look
      upon his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear alone remained with the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour after, Erebus was no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erebus was buried in the cemetery of La Ciotat. The black and gray monks
      of La Ciotat followed his funeral procession. When the service was over,
      they dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One penitent only remained long at the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very strange. He had taken no part in the chants or the ceremonies
      of the church, he had not sprinkled holy water on the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This penitent remained until night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with slow steps he travelled to a stream where he found a boat in
      which he embarked. That false penitent was Hadji. He had left his chebec
      and had landed, braving every peril in order to come and render homage to
      the memory of the unfortunate youth, whom he had, nevertheless, done so
      much to destroy. From that time no more was heard of the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre des Anbiez, until the end of his days, remained in a state which
      was one neither of reason, nor insanity. He was never heard to utter a
      word, although he continued to live at Maison-Forte. He never replied to a
      question, but every morning went to sit by the grave of his son, and there
      he remained until the evening, absorbed in profound meditation. Peyrou
      never left him, but the commander never seemed to recognise his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Elzear, after some months&rsquo; sojourn at Maison-Forte, began again his
      adventurous life as the ransomer of captives, and led that life until old
      age permitted him to travel no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine did not marry Honorât de Berrol. She remained faithful to the sad
      memory of Erebus. Some years after, the chevalier married, and Reine was
      the best of friends to him and to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V., healed of his wounds, rode Mistraon a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardinal Richelieu, informed of the courageous conduct of the baron at the
      time of the descent of the pirates, shut his eyes to the misdemeanours of
      the old malcontent in his dealings with the recorder Isnard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after, the Marshal of Vitry was sent to the Bastille, in
      consequence of his quarrel with the Archbishop of Bordeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimond V. felt that he was avenged, and, as much out of gratitude to the
      cardinal as for his sense of right, he ever after took a very venial part
      in rebellions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Luquin Trinquetaille married Stephanette, and although he had a
      blind confidence in his wife, which she deserved in every respect, he
      always regretted not having been able to drown the Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Laramée died in the service of the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The venerable Abbé Mascarolus continued to give wonderful recipes to Dame
      Dulceline, who made many Christmas cradles, which fortunately were not
      attended by such disastrous happenings as marred the Christmas festivity
      of 1632.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END. THE END.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
